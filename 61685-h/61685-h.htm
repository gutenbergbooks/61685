<h2 class="frontmatter">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> to produce workers of wonders or exponents of marvelous mysteries;
not to launch on an already over-crowded market a host of
professional or semi-professional entertainers&mdash;but rather to give to
those who can find real pleasure in amusing others, such knowledge as
shall enable them to transform the lagging winter hours into periods
of sheer delight, has this book been written.</p>

<p>While in no sense does it claim to be an exhaustive guide to home
amusements, it represents a serious effort to bring within the scope of
one volume almost every form of popular home diversion.</p>

<p>The subjects have been dealt with from a simple but perfectly practical
point of view. In addition to the different accomplishments being
so explained as to be easily comprehended and acquired, the successful
presentment of them is made possible at a minimum of expense. The
greatest difficulty which formerly faced the amateur entertainer was
the heavy cost of production, but even the most expensive form of
amusement explained in the following chapters comes well within the
modest &#8220;pocket-money bounds&#8221; of the average boy.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in &#8220;Home Fun&#8221; will be found much that is entirely
new concerning subjects about which little or nothing has hitherto been
written. Whereas the paths so well trodden by authorities on entertaining
are here more or less passed over, excursions are made into
equally fascinating by-ways, an acquaintance with the delights of which
cannot fail to win success and widespread approval for the promoter
of entertainments at home.</p>

<p>That those who follow the many chapters on subjects so amusing
and diverse may obtain from them as great pleasure as he who has
compiled them is the sincere wish of the author.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER I</b><br />
AMATEUR THEATRICALS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stage Construction and Home-made Scenery</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> many people are deterred from embarking on the sea of
amateur theatricals for the reason that the expense and trouble incurred
in providing an adequate stage, and in finding plays suitable for amateurs,
seem to outweigh other considerations.</p>

<p>The following hints and suggestions, then, are not intended for the
lordly Thespians who would aspire to flaunt their histrionic powers in
public assembly-room or civic town-hall. For them there are those who
make it their business to erect stages, provide &#8220;swell&#8221; scenery, and all
the paraphernalia required.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to act without a stage proper at all, especially
if you happen to live in a house that boasts a double drawing-room
with folding doors, in which case a curtain would also be a superfluity,
for the doors could be closed and thrown open when the audience are
in their places, though if a curtain should be deemed necessary it would
be an easy matter to fix a rod from door to door.</p>

<p>But before going on to the description of how to erect a stage of
a more pretentious character, it might be as well to offer a word or two
of warning. Remember that private theatricals are rather apt to turn
a house upside-down, so that before the performance is given it is of
importance to see that all breakables are stowed away, and that superfluous
furniture is disposed of.</p>

<p>If you are going to turn your drawing-room into a theater, take
care that your guests can enter without having to pick their way in
and out of needless chairs and tables. Details such as these may seem
trivial. They are, nevertheless, just the things that may make or mar
an entertainment.</p>

<p>Above all, let there be harmony. Once having chosen your stage-manager,
see to it that his word is law. Nothing is more galling or<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
disastrous than for every one to try and &#8220;boss the show.&#8221; And if
expense has to be considered, do not try to be too elaborate with your
accessories.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, possible for any one to erect in any drawing-room
of average dimensions a stage that will be found perfectly adaptable to
plays made adequate for it, and that without calling in the aid of any
professional carpenter or stage furnisher.</p>

<p>The stage can be constructed in the following simple manner:&mdash;Hire
a number of ordinary benches or stout boxes of equal dimensions,
and on these superimpose lengths of scaffold-boarding or planks. These
latter should be of equal thickness throughout, in order that a perfectly
level staging may be obtained. The whole may be made quite
secure by the judicious use of nails, although care should be taken
that no damage is done to the benches, or this will have to be paid
for when they are returned. A floor covering of felt or linoleum will
also prove serviceable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Drop Curtain</span></h3>

<p>An essential piece of stage furniture for amateur theatricals is the
drop curtain. It can be made from two equal widths of some serviceable
material such as
dark cretonne, supported
by brass rings
on a stout bamboo
rod, to either end of
which are attached
large steel eyes (A,
A, <a href="#Fig1_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Back view of drop curtain.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The bamboo rod
should be cut to such
a length that when
the eyes have been
added, the whole can
be fixed to steel hooks
screwed into the picture-molding on either side of the room. Should any
difficulty be experienced in procuring a rod of sufficient length, the
difficulty may be overcome by the use of two shorter pieces joined at
the middle by iron sockets.</p>

<p>In the case where it is intended to give the performance in either
a schoolroom or a small hall, a curtain of much greater size and of
stouter material would be required, and this latter can be supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
on a length of strong gas pipe held in position by brackets nailed to
the wall at each end.</p>

<p>The arrangement for raising or lowering the curtain is shown in
the <a href="#Fig1_1">diagram</a>, in which A A is the rod. A number of small brass rings
are then sewn to the back of the curtain, as at A X and A E. Top rings,
much larger, are also attached to the curtain and passed along the
rod. Cord is next run from X and E respectively through the rings
at A, and allowed to hang loose as at D. The bottom of the curtain
should be weighted with shot.</p>

<p>Four screens, two on each side, can also be requisitioned for the
wings, and a small steady table placed in each recess (<a href="#Fig1_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a>) for
moderator lamps&mdash;preferably
of the self-extinguishing
pattern,
in case they
should be upset by an
untoward accident&mdash;to
make up for the
deficiency of footlights,
though these
can be provided by
the aid of a little ingenuity,
<i>e.g.</i> candle
reading-lamps with
shades and reflectors
begged or borrowed
from accommodating neighbors. Tin cans cut in half, and night-lights
will serve the purpose equally well. Here, again, the inventive genius
of the promoters of the enterprise will have to be called into play.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig1_1A">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1<i>a</i>.&mdash;Showing arrangement of screens for exits

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>All risk of fire should be obviated as much as possible, and appliances
for the swift extinction of a blaze near at hand.</p>

<p>By the judicious arrangement of the screens it will be possible to
provide for exits and entrances on both sides of the stage.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Home-made Scenery</span></h3>

<p>Scenery, as a rule, proves a great barrier to the would-be promoters
of amateur theatrical enterprises. The purchase of suitable
surroundings for the presentation of various scenes is a luxury only
to be indulged in by the well-to-do. In fact, to carry out an ordinary
play on these lines involves the expenditure of many dollars. It
is hoped that the practical instructions given here will not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
avoid such unnecessary and perhaps unwarrantable expense, but will
also tend greatly to increase the interest of those taking part in the
work.</p>

<p>Where scenery is required, it is as well to confine oneself to a
play that takes place indoors, though, of course, it is possible even
without a back-drop to give a praiseworthy presentment of an open-air
scene by means of a plain background, against which are fastened
boughs of trees, while the judicious grouping of greenhouse plants can
be used at the sides, plus a plain green felt underfoot to add to the
effect. However, even these small items run away with money. Cut
boughs fade and need replacing, and this mode of constructing scenery
will often be found by the would-be economist to cost more than he
can reasonably afford.</p>

<p>Of course, for those who care to do so, proper mounted scenery
all ready for use may be purchased, but undoubtedly the better plan
is for the stage-manager to endeavor to find from amongst the members
of his company one or two who are expert in the use of tools. Generally
there are many such available, and by the aid of the following diagrams
and explanatory notes a most useful interior box scene (comprising
five &#8220;flats&#8221; which fit together and form the whole) can be constructed
at a cost certainly not exceeding $5.00.</p>

<p>By repapering and making other obvious alterations, such scenery
can be transformed as necessity demands to suit any particular play&mdash;that
is to say, the addition of a few hangings and pictures, and the
substitution of other appropriate furniture will speedily change a poor
man&#8217;s kitchen or parlor into quite a presentable stage drawing-room.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Make the &#8220;Flats&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>To deal first with the &#8220;flats&#8221; or separate parts of the scenery.
The primary essentials for these are a number of lengths of 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch
battening; other requisites being a plenitude of nails of all sizes, glue,
brown paper or canvas, powdered color, and size. The purpose of this
latter commodity is for painting the wood-work or any other desired
article, such as a sideboard, dresser, or fireplace.</p>

<p>Cut the battening to lengths appropriate to the dimensions of the
stage, or, in other words, with due regard to the height of the room
and the width and depth of the platform.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig1_2">Fig. 2</a> shows the general arrangement of the five &#8220;flats,&#8221; placed in
the order shown, with the largest one, consisting of the double doors,
in the center.</p>

<p>Now, as the width of these &#8220;flats&#8221; depends entirely upon the space
they occupy when put into the position indicated by the diagram, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
stage carpenter must commence his plan of construction with this fact
clearly in mind. Should a particularly large stage be available, then
it may be desirable to extend the scenery, in which case one or more
straight &#8220;flats,&#8221; similar to that numbered 4 in <a href="#Fig1_2">Fig. 2</a>, can be added at
each end or where desired.</p>

<p>The frame-work for the respective &#8220;flats&#8221; appears in
<a href="#Fig1_3">Figs. 3</a>, <a href="#Fig1_4">4</a>, <a href="#Fig1_5">5</a>,
and <a href="#Fig1_6">6</a>, the method of joining corners being indicated by the elevation
and sectional drawing depicted in the corner of <a href="#Fig1_5">Fig. 5</a>. The vertical
and horizontal supports are merely fitted in flush and glued. For
doors and window openings a slightly stouter battening will be found
necessary.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig1_3">Fig. 3</a> gives a clear idea of the main lines of construction of a
practical door, which is to be fixed to the &#8220;flat&#8221; by means of hinges.<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
When hingeing doors, take particular care so to place the hinges that
the doors swing outwards&mdash;that is, from the point of view of the
audience. This precaution obviates the necessity of painting both sides
of the doors.</p>

<p>A reference to <a href="#Fig1_4">Fig. 4</a> shows a window opening which can be used
either as a lattice, working on the same principle as the door, or as an
ordinary window, which can be suggested by gluing a strip of wood
horizontally across the center.</p>

</div><!--split6733-->

<p>In <a href="#Fig1_5">Fig. 5</a> the central opening (the double doors of the plan) serves
for curtains fixed to rods by means of sliding rings, or merely as
French windows. Of all the &#8220;flats,&#8221; this is the most valuable, because
it is capable of utilization in a multitude of ways. For instance, should
the scene be an elaborate drawing-room, the opening will lend itself
to French windows, through which can be seen park-land or gardens
in the distance. Again, for the presentment of a humble apartment,
it has only to be covered with a dresser or any other commonplace
article of furniture. Should an opening be required to another room,
curtains of course can be hung.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig1_6">Fig. 6</a> depicts a plain &#8220;flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next operation is the covering of the frames, accomplished by
the use of brown paper, or, should expenses permit, of canvas. The
brown paper is first cut to the size required, and then glued to the
frames, only the openings for windows and doors being left. If canvas
is chosen for the covering, nailing will be found necessary. To prevent
sagging, and to preserve the flat appearance of the material, coat thinly
and evenly with a solution of size and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Papering</span></h3>

<p>The next item for consideration is papering. A visit to almost
any paperhanger&#8217;s will reveal the fact, that the shopman possesses
quantities of certain designs, perhaps not quite large enough to be of
practical service to him for papering a room. In this circumstance
the stage carpenter should be able, by the expenditure of a few cents,
or a quarter at the outside, to obtain quite enough for his purpose.
Next, he can procure from any builder&#8217;s yard a few lengths of architrave
or beaded edging for doorways and windows. This will have to
be mitered and fixed to the frames. A few slips of board, with beading
along one edge, should also be purchased at the same time for fixing
to the bottom of the frames to form the skirting. Now paste the wall-paper
to the frames.</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Having satisfactorily constructed all the &#8220;flats,&#8221; fix them together
in the order shown in the plan&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> each to each&mdash;by means of pieces
of bent zinc and screws. Additional supports are often required, such
as iron brackets screwed to the bottom of the &#8220;flat&#8221; and the floor, as
indicated by the crosses in <a href="#Fig1_3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig1_5">5</a>.</p>

<p>To give a finished effect, paste brown paper over the whole of the
door frames, and produce the appearance of panels by the addition of
mitered thin beading or slips of wood (<a href="#Fig1_7">Fig. 7</a>). The door panels may<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
then be painted according to taste with a mixture of any powdered color
and dissolved size. The fixing of a knob or handle with a long screw
renders the thing complete.</p>

<p>Reference to the plan marked <a href="#Fig1_2">Fig. 2</a> reveals the fact, that the two
end &#8220;flats&#8221; (1 and 5 respectively) are alike. Now, while one of these
&#8220;flats&#8221; may be utilized for an interior door (<a href="#Fig1_3">Fig. 3</a>), it may be found
extremely useful so to prepare its fellow that it represents an exterior
cottage door, and to use it as a wing at one side of the stage in another
scene. It should then appear as in <a href="#Fig1_8">Fig. 8</a>. To obtain this result,
a section of scenery has to be covered with brown paper or canvas,
as already described for the interior door. Should canvas be decided
upon, first prepare it by adding a coating of mixed size and whiting,
to form a background for the painted design. In this case the door
itself is covered on the outside with paper, and lines are drawn down
to give an idea of planks nailed vertically together. A latch-handle
can either be purchased and fixed for a few cents, or an imitation one
painted in.</p>

<p>The lintel and doorposts are constructed by gluing or nailing battening
of a sufficiently stout nature, that it projects to the degree indicated
by the section in <a href="#Fig1_8">Fig. 8</a>. The purpose of this latter projection is to
allow for the addition of a latticed porch, which will give that picturesqueness
so essential to stage scenery.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making a Portable Porch</span></h3>

<p>A glance at <a href="#Fig1_9">Fig. 9</a> will put the amateur stage carpenter in full
possession of all details relating to the construction of this latticed
porch. Of course, it will be found necessary to make two pieces of the
part numbered 1&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the batten frame and cross-pieces&mdash;as one will
be fixed on either side of the door to support the roof. The lattice-work
may be purchased in a length, or made from laths, and nailed
to the frame. Fix the sides of the porch close up to the doorposts by
means of zinc brackets and pins, as indicated by the two crosses. Next
pin on the roof, as at 4, <a href="#Fig1_9">Fig. 9</a>. Paint the finished porch bright green
and the roof red.</p>

<p>A second reference to <a href="#Fig1_8">Fig. 8</a> shows that it suggests a design of
bricks, covered with creeper or a tree. If necessary, treat the other
side of the window &#8220;flat,&#8221; by painting it in similar fashion, and fix it
alongside the door to form an additional wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Portable Fireplace</span></h3>

<p>A very useful adjunct to the plain &#8220;flat&#8221; (<a href="#Fig1_6">Fig. 6</a>) is a portable
fireplace, which is depicted in detail in <a href="#Fig1_10">Fig. 10</a>. To make this, buy a
length or so of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch planking, one length of which should be cut
for the mantelpiece, according to the size required. Next cut two
supports of equal dimensions to form the sides (A, A, in elevation).
These are nailed to the &#8220;flat,&#8221; and the mantelpiece is kept in position
by two solid wooden brackets (D, D). Two slips are also added to the
base of the supports at E, E. The piece C is let in flush with A, A.</p>

<p>Below this, to the back of the rectangular opening, attach a piece
of very stout blackened cardboard, of the shape shown, leaving an
opening for a real or a painted grate (F). Should the former be preferred,
it may be produced from pieces of thin battening, as shown in
the elevation and section.</p>

<p>To obtain a realistic effect, fill the grate with non-inflammable metal
tinsel (C, C), and further to enhance the realism, support a small
galley-pot on a blackened bracket or block of wood (A), the galley-pot
being filled with cotton-wool soaked in methylated spirit. The
application of a match produces a flame at B (see section of grate,
<a href="#Fig1_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Movable Counter or Sideboard</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Fig1_11">Fig. 11</a> gives the front and back view of this very useful piece of
stage furniture, which may be utilized either as a counter, sideboard,
or bottom of a
dresser; or, appropriately
draped and surmounted
by a looking-glass,
it may serve as
a dressing-table.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig1_11">

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The sections are
illustrated in <a href="#Fig1_12">Fig. 12</a>,
the pieces marked 1
forming the sides, 2
the top, and 3 the
front. Steel eyes are
numbered 4, and their purpose is to hold the sides, front, and top
together by strong cord, attached as in the back view of <a href="#Fig1_11">Fig. 11</a>.
5 in <a href="#Fig1_12">Fig. 12</a> is a projecting panel, also seen in the front view of
Fig. 11. 6 (<a href="#Fig1_12">Fig. 12</a>) indicates the back supports to which the front
joined boards are nailed. The
beading which is fixed along
three sides of the top is seen
at 7 (<a href="#Fig1_13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>Having thoroughly
grasped the details outlined
above, commence to make
the sideboard from <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch
boarding.</p>

<p>To each of the side-pieces
add a bottom support of
stouter material, marked with
a cross in <a href="#Fig1_12">Fig. 12</a>. The
front is next placed across the
supports in such a position that the top fits down on them and holds
all three pieces in place. (See dotted line at 7, <a href="#Fig1_13">Fig. 13</a>; this diagram
also depicts the separate pieces in elevation.)</p>

<p>It is not worth while &#8220;spoiling the ship for a ha&#8217;p&#8217;orth o&#8217; tar,&#8221; or,
in this instance, the sideboard for a coat of paint. Before applying
this latter, paste the structure over with brown paper, and then give
it a coating of yellow ochre and size. A grained appearance may be
produced by utilizing an old coarse comb, the fine grain being attained<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
with the thin teeth and the coarse grain with the stout. To obtain the
graining, proceed as follows: on the dry coating of yellow ochre put
a second coating of dark brown ochre, mixed with size as before, and
whilst wet comb in zigzag lines.</p>

<p>The great advantage attaching to all the scenery and artificial
furniture described is that it can be easily fitted together, taken to
pieces, and packed flat, thus occupying a minimum of space. For
practical purposes it will be found quite equal both in appearance and
for durability to that for which many dollars are charged at a theatrical
supply dealer&#8217;s.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Back-Cloth</span></h3>

<p>The construction of home-made theatrical effects may be closed
with brief hints regarding the much-needed and ever-useful back-cloth,
which plays a part in most exterior scenes, such as park lands, gardens,
&amp;c. It consists of several lengths of calico joined together to form a
square of the size required. This is then fixed on a large wooden roller
with a similar roller at the bottom to weight it, and prepared with a
coating of size and whiting.</p>

<p>A friend of unquestionable artistic ability should be asked to paint
in a view or other scenery.</p>

<p>In scene-painting bear in mind that only the brightest and most
vivid colors are to be used. The colors are made from powder mixed
with size, and must be applied with broad touches for distant effects.
The back-cloth can be fixed according to the means available.</p>

<p>For the proscenium, three pieces of wood to suit breadth and size
of stage must be requisitioned, the portion destined for the top being
gently sloped from an arch or apex in direct line with the center of<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
the curtain, and covered with some tastefully-colored paper which gives
the appearance of heavy satin panels.</p>

<p>A sewing bee should be formed among the ladies interested in the
company, and she who has sufficient prowess with her scissors should
be chosen to cut the garments and superintend the needlework of her
friends. This will prove a profitable way of spending the long winter
afternoons.</p>

<p>Imitation hair wigs, beards, &amp;c., may be procured at various
prices.</p>

<p>The best plan to adopt in finding a play suited to the limitations of
material of an embryo company is to spend a small sum on some &#8220;Guide
to Selecting Plays.&#8221; In these pages will be found abundant suggestions
and explanations of specimens, dealing from the simplest one-act,
thirty minutes&#8217; production to the five-act, three hours&#8217; drama. The
outline of each plot is given, and a summary of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
required.</p>

<p>Miss Keating&#8217;s &#8220;Plot of Potzentausend,&#8221; for example, is an excellent
one-act play, in which only male characters are required. Interest
in the fair sex is, however, cleverly maintained, for the four swains
have each a lass to occupy their affections.</p>

<p>The costumes, a description of which is given on the front page,
are of the time of Louis XIV., and the scene is a small frontier village
in Germany. This is an admirable, amusing, and not too ambitious performance
for boys home for the holidays.</p>

<p><i>Grindstone</i> is a miller of a sour and unfriendly disposition. He is
secretly involved in small political intrigues, and, in order to meet the
Chevalier d&#8217;Espion without the knowledge of the villagers, refuses to
allow the lads and lasses their usual yearly privilege of dancing in his
barn, to which they naturally take exception. Grindstone&#8217;s personality
and physical appearance are as gray, grim, and cold as the substance
after which he is named. He is tight of lip, thin of figure, and possessed
of a countenance which expresses a miserly cunning, dislike of frivolities,
and hypocritical semblance of virtue. Although vastly respected,
he is not overwhelmed with the affections of his fellow-men, and is
termed, even by his servant Sacks, to be something of a rogue.</p>

<p><i>Sacks</i>, his man, is a thick-set hunchback, with a round, jolly face
and optimistic temperament, which presents a strong contrast to his
master&#8217;s saturnine character.</p>

<p><i>Max</i>, a young sergeant, of smart demeanor, is weighted by a sense
of his own importance, insipid of face, and overbearingly superior in
manners.</p>

<p><i>Louis</i>, a lawyer&#8217;s clerk, pale and meek, rat-faced and rather wily,
grasping in disposition, and something of a flirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span></p>

<p><i>Fritz</i>, a young peasant, whose sentences generally terminate with
&#8220;as a body may say,&#8221; shows a priggish and cautious attitude to preserve
his own skin at any cost. His expression is a delightful mixture of
rustic placidity and guileless cunning.</p>

<p>The <i>Chevalier d&#8217;Espion</i>, a smart, condescending person of uncertain
age and carefully preserved complexion; his gold lace and feathers
lend him as irreproachable an aloofness and pride as the peacock demonstrates
towards the jackdaw.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Plan of Room in Grindstone&#8217;s House</i></p>

<img src="images/illo023.png" alt="" width="600" height="239" />

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The table should be covered with a cloth sufficiently long to touch
the ground on all sides. The rear of the high-backed chair and window-curtain
are to be used as hiding-places, and must be practicable for the
purpose. Small chairs and an old stool are also required. Except for
a small lighted lamp which Sacks, the first to enter, places on the table,
the stage is in darkness.</p>

<p>This play takes thirty-five minutes. The plot is built on the misunderstanding
that arises between the four swains&mdash;who have unconsciously
chosen the same place and hour to meet their ladies&mdash;and the
Chevalier d&#8217;Espion, who, expecting to find a quartette of fellow-conspirators,
mistakes them for such in disguise. Soldiers appear to arrest
the Chevalier, who manages to escape. Sacks proves the identity of
the rest, and so all ends happily.</p>

<p>The dialogue must be brisk and the action kept interesting. Acted
in the right spirit, it cannot fail to produce roars of merriment. It has
a further advantage of not being too great a strain on the memorizing
powers of those who have never previously essayed to learn prose by
heart.</p>

<p>A reliable prompter, concealed from the audience, should be
close at hand. His business is to follow the dialogue intently, giving
aid when necessary in a clear, low voice. Words should never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
whispered, nor too loudly spoken. A happy medium is acquired by
experience.</p>

<p>The make-up required by the characters is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sacks</i> (florid flesh tint), grease paint (red) No. 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>; a slight cobweb
of good-natured wrinkles and crowsfeet, such as would be caused by
laughter. Red, black, or gray wig, according to taste.</p>

<p><i>Grindstone</i> (sallow flesh tint), chrome grease paint; peevish and
discontented lines about the mouth, furrowed forehead, peruke slightly
gray, nose paste to enlarge nose, sparse ruffled eyebrows.</p>

<p><i>Louis</i> (sallow flesh tint), chrome grease paint; peruke any color
fancied, premature wrinkles, small white. A few front teeth in upper
gum stopped out with small noir.</p>

<p><i>Max</i> sunburnt. <i>Fritz</i> ruddy. The <i>Chevalier d&#8217;Espion</i> bronzed. Officer
and guard, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> medium flesh.</p>

<p>Another fascinating play for boys is &#8220;The Poor Relation,&#8221; also
written by Miss Keating, and included with &#8220;The Plot of Potzentausend&#8221;
in &#8220;A Series of Original Comedies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grease paints should be composed of pure chemical fat and colors
free from lead, otherwise they will make havoc with sensitive skins.</p>

<p>Artificial complexions should never be scrubbed from the face by
means of soap and water.</p>

<p>Cocoa butter gently applied on the corner of a soft dry towel will
rapidly erase every mark, and is an excellent tonic for the skin.</p>

<p>Grease paints, rouge powder, cocoa butter, spirit gum, sponge-towel,
puff, cr&ecirc;pe hair, hare&#8217;s foot, patches, tongs, hairpins, joining paste,
brush and comb, lip salve, liquid blanc de perle, scissors, mirror, mustache,
vanquisher, needles, cotton, soap, sponge, &amp;c., can be purchased
in compact make-up cases at prices from $15.00 down
to $2.50.</p>

<p>Amateurs are sometimes prone to stiffness and artificiality of gesture
and exaggeration of expression, also to too much or too little movement.
A perfectly natural manner can only be gained by throwing
oneself whole-heartedly into the play, and uniting oneself with the
other dramatis person&aelig;. Acting editions of both playlets mentioned
above may be obtained of Messrs. Samuel French, of 28 West 38th St.,
New York.</p>

<p>Each actor has, as it were, his little orbit of movement, but this
should not be circumscribed in a conventional, studied manner. Ease
and self-control should cover all mastered technique in voice, attitude,
and gesture. Words should be clearly delivered, and pronounced without
any pedantic phrasing or forced utterance; and this will only be
achieved by constant and careful rehearsing. The personality of each
character must be distinct and individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span></p>

<p>When an amateur company is formed, each member should pay a
fee in proportion to the strength of the casts and the drama they hope
to produce. The stage-manager&#8217;s choice of characters should stand
inviolable, providing, of course, he presents sufficient discretion and
insight to distinguish between the different trends of talent possessed
by his players.</p>

<p>In almost every company there are a few players who are inclined
to fancy that they can do justice to a r&ocirc;le given to some one else, rather
than to the one they are studying. This is a form of very human discontent
which Quince, the stage-manager of the players in &#8220;A Midsummer
Night&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; had to battle against.</p>

<p>Flute bemoaned his fate, and excused himself from playing the
woman&#8217;s part, on the plea, &#8220;I have a beard coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bottom was torn between a desire to undertake Thisby and the lion.
&#8220;I will roar that I will make the duke say, &#8216;Let him roar again, let him
roar again.&#8217; ... I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove.&#8221;</p>

<p>As adamantine as the sagacious Quince against these eloquent appeals
must be the modern stage-manager when the would-be tragedian
importunes him to play the heavy r&ocirc;le, or the individual who
believes himself endowed with hidden genius, to portray the part of light
comedian.</p>

<p>Thus only is success achieved.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER II</b><br />
MYSTERIES OF MAKE-UP</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Foundation</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary that the amateur who wishes to make his efforts at
private theatricals a success should have a fair knowledge of the art
of &#8220;make-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>While no great amount of money need be expended, at the same
time the best results can be obtained only from the use of good cosmetics.
Grease paints, obtainable from any purveyors of theatrical appliances,
are excellent and not very expensive.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many people consider it quite sufficient to
dab a little paint on the face, smear it over carelessly with the addition
of some powder, and imagine, quite erroneously, that they are well
made-up.</p>

<p>The outward signs of character are to be represented by &#8220;make-up,&#8221;
and it is quite essential that this effect should be produced; therefore,
with a slight knowledge of what is to be avoided, and what effected,
the home-actor should attain to some degree of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wig-paste,&#8221; No. 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, is usually considered the best foundation for
pink complexions, and according to shade required, deeper colors can
be used, such as 3, 4, &amp;c. Thus, if being made up for the part of a
pretty young girl, the first number is best; if for a middle-aged woman,
No. 3; while for elderly men of choleric temperament No. 4 would be
more suitable.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the foundation of wig-paste should
be carefully put on, and well smoothed before the structure or blending
of colors to produce a natural appearance is commenced. Whether
this is done well or badly will make all the difference to the final
results.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lining</span></h3>

<p>Lining is an important part of &#8220;make-up,&#8221; by its aid the lines of
the face being diminished or deepened, shadows created for sunken
effects, and &#8220;high lights&#8221; produced&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> touching up the cheek-bones
to give them prominence. By careful use of this latter branch of
&#8220;make-up&#8221; the whole character of the face can be changed. High<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
lights are produced by a lighter shade of grease paint than that used
for the rest of the complexion, being placed upon the feature to be
emphasized; for instance, if the actor wishes his nose to appear thinner,
he will draw a straight white line from the top to the tip, enhancing
the effect with a careful application of the gray paint (<a href="#Fig2_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a>). The
cheek-bone, nose, chin, and brow are parts of the face which are made
up for high lights, though if wrinkles are to be accentuated this is usually
done by the addition of a &#8220;high light&#8221; effect on each side of the existing
dark line (<a href="#Fig2_1B">Figs. 1<i>b</i></a> and <a href="#Fig2_1C">1<i>c</i></a>).</p>

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>To make cheeks appear hollow, gray-lining paint is used, the effect
of emaciation being produced by the careful blending of the last-named
paint with the grease paint previously put on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig2_2">

<img src="images/illo028a.png" alt="" width="225" height="414" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Low lights.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Shadows, or low lights, give the effect of hollowed cheeks and
sunken eyes, and instead of making features more pronounced, as is
the case with a careful &#8220;high light&#8221; make-up, decrease the prominence
which certain parts usually possess (<a href="#Fig2_2">Fig. 2</a>). When making-up for a
beldame, or some other character which should appear more than usually
haggard, a striking effect is obtained by adding
a spot of either dark-gray or brown, and blending
it outwards.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w230" id="Fig2_3">

<img src="images/illo028b.png" alt="" width="213" height="159" />

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The lining of the eyes requires special attention,
more particularly as their appearance depends
so much upon the change of the eyelids
(<a href="#Fig2_3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig2_4">4</a>); eyelashes too, when properly
treated, make a vast difference to the usual
expression.</p>

<p>When it is necessary that the eyelashes should
be more pronounced, black grease paint is put on
to the end of an artist&#8217;s stump, melted very slowly
by being held over a candle or other flame, and
so applied. Care should be taken, however, that
no grease paint goes into the eye, so when melting
it must not be allowed to become too soft.
Black-lining grease paint is the best for eyelashes,
and the amount applied depends entirely upon their natural thickness
and darkness.</p>

<p>For darkening or lightening the eyebrows, grease paint &#8220;liners&#8221;
are indispensable, and much preferable to India ink. Sometimes it
is necessary to obliterate part of the eyebrow before the rest is &#8220;drawn-in,&#8221;
in which case it is first of all coated with soap and then covered
with the same grease paint as used for the groundwork of &#8220;make-up.&#8221;
This done carefully, and toned to the same shade as the rest of face,
leaves the actor free to &#8220;draw-in&#8221; any shaped eyebrow he desires.
For a very thin eyebrow a toothpick can be utilized to advantage, a
little melted grease paint being rubbed upon it, and the line drawn
with it (<a href="#Fig2_5">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig2_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>For Oriental effects the obliteration of the eyebrows is essential,<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
and fresh ones with an upward tendency can be drawn-in at will, when
once the natural ones have been made to disappear.</p>

<p>More often than not it is necessary to increase the eyebrows, making
them look thick and heavy, and if Nature has endowed the player with
massive ones, it is an easy matter to comb them up the wrong way
and apply a small quantity of grease-paint; but if they are naturally
thin the aid of false ones must be sought. Cr&ecirc;pe hair, which is an
indispensable accessory to the &#8220;make-up&#8221; art, can here be brought into
use, the ever-helpful &#8220;adhesia&#8221; being required as well.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w260" id="Fig2_5">

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The best plan is to model on a comb the eyebrow according to the
shape desired; then, placing the latter in position, make it fast with
the use of the adhesia, taking care that the gum is only on the edges
and not on the hair of the real eyebrow.</p>

<p>To obtain a sinister expression, eliminate the outer edges of the
eyebrows and paste a piece of cr&ecirc;pe hair over the eyebrows near the
nose, the Mephistophelian effect being gained in the same way, except
that the outer corners should curl upwards (<a href="#Fig2_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#Fig2_8">8</a>). By fixing
on pieces of cr&ecirc;pe hair so that they meet over the nose, a stern and even
fierce expression is produced.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Juvenile&#8221; Make-up</span></h3>

<p>In making-up for the character of a juvenile, the strength of light
on the platform or stage is to be taken into consideration. If a fairly
strong light, the make-up must not be too deep, but the player will
soon become experienced in this matter by taking the trouble to consider
the effect of different lights.</p>

<p>Before commencing with the grease paints the face is well rubbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
with cold cream or cocoa butter, and wiped with a
towel, so that none of the former remains visible.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200" id="Fig2_9">

<img src="images/illo030a.png" alt="" width="200" height="348" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;Preliminary
lining.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The flesh-colored paint may now be drawn
across the face several times, the method of procedure
being: two lines across forehead, two on
each cheek, one down the nose, and several on
the neck (<a href="#Fig2_9">Fig. 9</a>). With the palms of the hands
this is smoothed over carefully, and finally rubbed
quite lightly with a dry towel. The foundation
is thus formed, and is really the most important
part of the make-up, for if not carefully done
the rest will be unsatisfactory. One of the chief
facts to be borne in mind is that very little
paint should be used, so little as to be scarcely
seen.</p>

<p>Rouge is next applied, red-lining paint or paste lip-rouge being
used upon the cheek-bones, and carefully smoothed until it tones with
the flesh on the cheeks. After an application of
powder, when the face feels perfectly smooth,
comes the task of lining-in, which has already
been described.</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The lip-rouge accentuates the lips (<a href="#Fig2_10">Figs. 10</a>
and <a href="#Fig2_11">11</a>), and should it be necessary to make
them of a more symmetrical appearance, this
may be accomplished by extending the rouge
a trifle beyond the natural outlines, though
women need this little extra touch more often
than men. When it is required to make the
chin more prominent, a touch of dry rouge
beneath the lower lip will accomplish the effect,
still more being added to the cheeks if they
are not quite colored enough (<a href="#Fig2_12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>For juvenile darky parts, burnt cork will
do instead of the grease paints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Middle-Age&#8221; Make-up</span></h3>

<p>This is perhaps the most difficult make-up, for it is much easier
to go to one extreme from another, than to make a fairly young person
look like a middle-aged one (<a href="#Fig2_13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>In the case of a man it is advisable to depend on the addition of
whiskers and mustache, and even glasses or spectacles lend age.</p>

<p>A sallow paint is usually required for middle-age make-up, and
it can be blended with a lighter paint for pale effects; but to produce
a hearty bloom or florid complexion, the application of a little red or
brown is recommended.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The mid-gray wig is also an immense aid, but failing this, a small
amount of powder sifted over the hair will give a similar effect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Old-Age&#8221; Make-up</span></h3>

<p>If the character desired to be represented is carefully studied, notice
being taken of where there is a high light and where the shadows of
the face lie, there should be little or no difficulty in producing a lifelike
representation.</p>

<p>Particular notice should be taken of wrinkles and lines, and these
must be carefully blended as in <a href="#Fig2_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>The next essential is the wig, either gray or white being the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
useful. For the old age complexion it is better to get the grease paint
for that purpose; but when the necessity for it is but seldom, an application
of the sallow paint, or in the case of great emaciation, the addition
of a little blue, well blended, will create quite a good effect.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The hands must receive careful attention when the face and neck<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
are finished, and &#8220;made-up&#8221; according to character. If juvenile, they
require coloring; if middle-age, a little of the sallow paint: the veins
accentuated, and the flesh made to look pale for old age parts
(<a href="#Fig2_16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p>When measuring for a wig, take the various lengths and widths
as indicated by the numerals in <a href="#Fig2_17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beards and Mustaches</span></h3>

<p>The most inexpensive of these necessary adjuncts to the home entertainer&#8217;s
make-up are undoubtedly those he models for himself from
cr&ecirc;pe hair, which can be bought in a plait and untwined as it is wanted,
a coarse-toothed comb being passed through it. With a few twirls it
can be made the desired shape and cut, and when wanted for a beard,
opened out until it has a hollow cone-shape appearance, and placed on
the chin after a thin coating of adhesia has been applied.</p>

<p>The same method applies to eyebrow and mustache making. When
it is desired to create an unshaven, unkempt effect, pieces of cr&ecirc;pe
hair are cut up exceedingly fine on to a newspaper, the chin covered
with adhesia and the finely-cut hair sifted evenly over the skin. These
little pieces are also useful for sprinkling where the false beard meets
the face, in order to take away the &#8220;abrupt&#8221; appearance that is often
produced.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Removal of Make-up</span></h3>

<p>Having told how to put on make-up, a few instructions for its easy
removal may not be out of place. Whilst soap and water will take off
the grease paint, the simpler method is to remove it with one of the
following: Cold cream, cocoa butter, or olive oil. Vaseline is to be
avoided, as it will often cause a growth of hair; and for this reason
when purchasing cold cream it is advisable to procure the best, for in
the cheaper makes vaseline is largely employed. Pieces of cloth kept
specially for the removal of &#8220;make-up&#8221; are to be recommended, one
for taking the chief layer off and another of soft texture for final
rubbing before the much-needed wash is resorted to.</p>

<p>For dispelling traces of the prepared burnt cork used for minstrels
and negro burlesques, a pure vegetable soap is all that is required.</p>

as pliable and elastic as his face; his very nature appears to undergo
a swift metamorphosis of changes in the adoption of the various manners,
idiosyncrasies, attitude, and gait of the character he portrays.
Although agile and unerring, he possesses something of the stoic calm
of the hedgehog, and is as natural in his art as when partaking of a
beefsteak in privacy.</p>

<p>He flashes before the vision on stage or drawing-room platform in
dress so immaculate that it would seem to the uninitiated that his toilet
is the result of hours of care and deliberation. In the costume of
an old-world dandy he struts about, swaying his long-laced sleeves
with exquisite grace over his snuff-box, the while he patters his part.
A moment after, like a shooting star, he has swung himself through a
door, reappearing almost instantaneously by means of another entrance,
transformed in wig and attire to a totally different individual in age and
character.</p>

<p>Thus he continues playing his many parts so nimbly that one can
scarcely believe he has not a bevy of actors hidden in the wings ready
to fly through doors and windows as quickly as a cork pops from
a bottle.</p>

<p>That his agility is grounded on a studied method, and his versatile
acting the result of wheels within wheels, well-oiled, and precise as
the mechanism of a clock, is difficult to believe until his secrets of
manipulation are revealed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it done?&#8221; whispers the youth, palpitating with aspirations
to do likewise. Well, in only one way&mdash;that way simplicity itself, when
once practice has made it perfect.</p>

<p>I am dealing now with the man who produces a play in which
each r&ocirc;le is played by himself, and will proceed to explain his<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
proceedings from the start, so that the ambitious amateur may, at the
next Christmas party or home gathering, try a humble imitation, and
gradually achieve glory and greatness in the eyes of his family.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Inexpensive &#8220;Stock in Trade&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>Let us study the tools and qualities essential to the quick-change
artist. His stock and properties are all inexpensive, save the wigs.
It is not advisable to purchase cheap ones, as they soon show the
signs of wear; while hair in good condition, and carefully kept, lasts
for years.</p>

<p>His wardrobe contains garments of the cheapest material, and here
the old clothes-bag of the house, in which articles doomed for a jumble
sale are placed, is invaluable. A clever needle and a little ingenious
manipulation result in splendid effects.</p>

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Every garment is made in one piece, and fastens at the back of
the performer by means of clock springs, which may be purchased
from any clockmaker (<a href="#Fig3_1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig3_1A">1<i>a</i></a>). The springs are pliable bands
of steel, cut and rounded, according to the size required, and punched
with small holes, by means of which they are fixed with stitches to
neck, waist, legs and wrists. These springs should be carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
concealed in the hem, with sufficient material over to hide the opening
at the back.</p>

<p>There is no time for fastening of buttons, tying of strings, adjusting
of pins, or plastering of gum. Even the mustaches used are fixed
by means of small silver springs, which adhere to the interior of the
nostrils as firmly as the springs of eyeglasses pinch the top of the nose
(<a href="#Fig3_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig3_2">

<img src="images/illo036.png" alt="" width="600" height="131" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Back and front view of mustache fixed by spring.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The scenery required is also easily manufactured at home by the
amateur carpenter. Thick brown paper, light wooden frames, or, better
still, samples of wallpaper, fixed with small brass hinges, will serve
excellently as an interior.</p>

<p>Until the student is far advanced in dexterity, it is wisest to limit
his production to one environment.</p>

<p>The first thing, of course, is to choose a suitable piece. If you
are clever with your pen, you may compose a sketch to please yourself.
This is a good plan, for you will be governed in your production by
what is most suitable and easy to your limitations. If, however, no
suitable idea presents itself to you, go to any good dramatic firm, and
spend a morning in looking through plays until you alight on something
answering to your purpose.</p>

<p>In choosing a play, avoid an elaborate cast, complicated plot, or
speeches. Long monologues are wearisome and monotonous; while,
on the other hand, conversations of too rapid a character will be impossible
to manage satisfactorily, however skillful your manipulation.</p>

<p>The novice should begin with a curtain raiser, containing two or
three persons, and the movement should be brisk and interesting. Having
fixed on his play, he studies his scenery.</p>

<p>He must have sufficient entrances and exits. To use only one, so
that the audience always knows through which door he is about to
appear, spoils the effect of his cunning. It is far more dramatic
to burst upon them from a direction least expected, and, to do this
successfully, as many doors or windows are necessary, as in a production
played by several persons; but these should not be so placed
as to be aggressively prominent,&mdash;curtains, palms, screens, a sham<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
cupboard or fireplace, by means of which sudden comings and goings
lend a thrilling reality to every movement. <a href="#Fig3_3">Fig. 3</a> depicts a suggested
plan.</p>

<p>The different costumes to be used should be numbered in the order
required, and this is where a cool-headed and reliable dresser is absolutely
essential.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig3_3">

<img src="images/illo037.png" alt="" width="600" height="380" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Suggested plan of scenery arrangement for the quick-change artist.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>To robe oneself by means of picking up garments and wigs from
chair or different pegs is slow work, and leaves the stage empty for too
long a time to keep the spectators interested in one&#8217;s movements. The
swiftest manipulation will be too slow to those awaiting the re-appearance,
and, unless the movement is kept jogging, there will be no semblance
of reality in the performance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dresser</span></h3>

<p>The dresser plays a part no less important than the artist. Upon
leaving the stage the latter immediately wrenches from his person the
garment in which he has just appeared. The dresser is close to the exit
with costume No. 2 held out widely. The performer walks straight
into the clothes, of which the clock springs are widely expanded. In a
flash they close round his person. Another dresser adjusts wig, beard,
&amp;c., as he passes to his next entrance (<a href="#Fig3_4">Fig. 4</a>),
with the result that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
appears to answer the remark made by himself in the character No. 1
without any break being perceptible to the audience. Whilst speaking
the words in the r&ocirc;le of No. 2, the dresser is awaiting him at the next
exit with No. 3 or No. 1 clothes, (if No. 1 and 2 are having a conversation),
which he has swiftly picked up from the floor when
discarded.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in order to be of real service the dresser must be
as familiar with the words of the play as the performer. It is not
enough only to know the cues. He must, by his knowledge, calculate
to a hairbreadth how long No. 2 takes to reply, and be prepared upon
the instant of exit with the apparel of No. 1.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig3_4">

<img src="images/illo038.png" alt="" width="600" height="368" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;System of &#8220;changing&#8221; behind the scenes.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A plan of modes of entrances and exits should be arranged beforehand
between actor and dresser, and never altered. Each sketch must
be founded on a different plan, and in each the movements should be
so carefully practiced that they become almost a habit. Any chance
alteration or mistake leads to bungling and loss of time, for, if No. 1
disappears through the exit fixed upon for No. 2, naturally the dresser
will not be there awaiting him, and this mischance will probably throw
all the succeeding movements into confusion.</p>

<p>The quick-change artist is employed in a race with time, and, time
being swift and fleet of foot, the human competitor cannot possibly
afford to loiter or blunder.</p>

<p>In a play or sketch in which several characters are to be impersonated<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
it does not make for speed to have installed as many dressers
behind the scenes. One, or at the most, two reliable and experienced
assistants are ample. A larger number will only hinder the artist&#8217;s and
their own movements.</p>

<p>That there is a certain amount of nervous strain about this mode of
performance cannot be denied, but, by constant practice and coolness,
the artist greatly facilitates the mental effort that accompanies his portrayals.</p>

<p>A sketch should at most be of a half-hour&#8217;s duration. The actor
needs some knowledge of acting, and must be able to change his voice
to the different pitches required. It should range from the high-pitched
falsetto of the aggressive female type of uncertain years to the gruff
bass of the dogmatic father, while the cooing notes of the immaculate
heroine should be carefully cultivated.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The artist must of necessity be clean-shaven, so that he can adapt
beard, &#8220;mutton chops,&#8221; or mustache as required.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig3_5">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig3_6">6</a> show completed examples of one-piece transformations.
<a href="#Fig3_7">Fig. 7</a> depicts coat and breeches combined.</p>

<p>Most important of all the quick-change artist must be self-reliant,
self-confident, and absolute master of emotions engendered by nervousness,
for these lead to loss of memory where words and modes of entrance
and exit are concerned. While on the stage his mind must be
concentrated on the part he is playing to the exclusion of everything else,<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
his attention as completely focused upon the impersonation as though
the other characters were being undertaken by different individuals.</p>

<p>For many of these practical suggestions the writer is indebted to
a versatile quick-change artist, who willingly revealed some of the
secrets connected with his favorite form of entertainment. He emphasized
the fact that success is not achieved by means of numerous
wigs and costumes&mdash;a performer may possess the most elaborate wardrobe,
repertoire, and paraphernalia, and yet sadly fail to move the interest
and sympathy of his spectators.</p>

<p>As this artist remarked, the true art lies in facial expression, gesture,
attitude, and change of voice. These must be cultivated assiduously
before any one-man play is produced, for it is only when the features
are plastic as rubber, gesture and attitude the perfection of mimicry,
the voice containing every note in the range in which language is expressed,
that the steep ladder of success is scaled, and the timid novice
becomes transformed into the popular resourceful artist.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER IV</b><br />
CHARACTER IMPERSONATIONS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Talent</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Material Aids</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> popular means of amusing a house-party is the impersonation
of various characters. It is an entertainment more suitable to the limits
of a drawing-room than tableaux or amateur theatricals, which of
necessity entail a certain amount of expense, scenery, lighting, and much
labor and anxiety in securing and drilling an efficient cast.</p>

<p>Although it is doubtless true that this art needs some natural talent,
skill, and mastery of detail, much can be done by practice and self-reliance.</p>

<p>A clever man in the street amuses a long line of patient theater-goers,
his only paraphernalia being a soft, pliable disc of black felt.</p>

<p>The metamorphosis that article undergoes in his hands is a marvel.
Dexterously he wields it&mdash;a mere twist, and it is the three-cornered
biretta of a cardinal. Another, and it shades the villainous glare of a
brigand, who appears quite capable of cutting the throats of his audience.
A deft touch and a strut, and it tops the head of a swaggering dandy.
Next it shades the solemn, ascetic features of the priest. Tipped to
a different angle, and the cockney grins with happy-go-lucky impertinence.
Thus it is used to represent every grade of society from the
highest to the lowest of humanity.</p>

<p>But miraculous as that piece of felt seems, it is really the eyes and
gestures of the artist plying it that lend it personality, power, and magic
of transformation. In the hands of one ignorant of the tricks, it is
a futile and clumsy piece of mechanism.</p>

<p>A man may put a tea-cosy on his head and look absurd; another
does the same, and behold!&mdash;a living Napoleon stands before us. The
greater the artist, the simpler the preparations used, for the skilled
representative trusts to eyes, gesture, and figure rather than to the
material used.</p>

<p>Elasticity of feature is essential. Without this it is impossible to
produce a living likeness. One may possess wigs, beards, eyebrows,
sham noses, and skulls of every imaginable shape and size, and yet fail
through inability to assume the expression peculiar to the study undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p>In rehearsing impersonations a mirror is as good and true a friend
as in reciting. Observe how faithfully it reflects every change in the
human countenance.</p>

<p>Supposing the character studied to be that of King Lear. First read
your Shakespeare and memorize the lines which reach the very crisis
of the agony and woe of love of that unfortunate monarch, as when,
turning to his ungrateful, malignant daughters, Regan and Goneril,
he <span class="nowrap">cries&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&#8220;I will do such things,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they are yet I know not,... but they shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrors of the earth. You think I&#8217;ll weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, I&#8217;ll not weep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have full cause for weeping, but this heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ere I&#8217;ll weep. O fool! I shall go mad!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>Understand the breaking, raging, heart-throbbing beneath them.
Repeat them aloud before the glass, with wild, burning eyes and quivering
lips, with shaking hands upthrown and tensely up-drawn figure,
and by-and-by, if not at once, you will see King Lear peering at you
distraught.</p>

<p>When you have thoroughly gripped that image you may crown it
with snowy hair, pent brows, and ragged beard&mdash;but not till then.</p>

<p>And now, supposing, for a change&mdash;for there is nothing like
variety&mdash;you undertake so utterly different a character as that of his
faithful fool. Here no jingling bells and jester&#8217;s folly are needed
to aid you, for these may be, and frequently are, but the danger signals
to discerning eyes of incompetent treatment; you want his shrewd,
loyal heart in your breast, his pulse beating in your brain, your finger-tips.
His cunning grin must be a wavering crack in a wizened face as
you memorize such caustic saws <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast pared thy wit o&#8217; both sides, and left nothing i&#8217; the
middle; here comes one o&#8217; the parings.&#8221;</p>

<p>This method of memorizing and voicing some sentiment characteristic
of the figure presented, is only for private use during rehearsals.</p>

<p>Costume performances are dumb, and, this being the case, it is easy
to realize how eloquent and exact the physical contour must be for
faithful similitude.</p>

<p>Regard the <i>idea</i> as an object being photographed. When you have
gripped it, and, as it were, posed it before the camera of your brain,
focus, produce, and develop it on your features, which may well be
likened to a film.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Knowledge from Nature</span></h3>

<p>In order to master the idiosyncrasies, mannerisms, eccentricities,
and habits of characters, study is essential, and for this reason it is
probably best to acquire knowledge, not from imaginary heroes of fiction
or drama, but from the fount of Nature.</p>

<p>Popular statesmen, musicians, admirals, soldiers, prelates, scientists,
novelists, and famous actors walk our streets to-day, and each
possesses some anomaly of expression, feature, speech, gesture, or mannerism
which is distinctly his own, and distinguishes him from his kind.
Just as no two leaves of a tree or petals of a flower are exact duplicates,
so in mankind&mdash;no matter how subtle the anomaly&mdash;it exists, and must
be fathomed and included in the portrait; delicately if it is delicate,
proportionately broadly and ostentatiously as it is broad and ostentatious.</p>

<p>For example, there are some persons whose peculiarities are as
evasive and subtle as the bouquet of a wine, the bloom of a grape.
We feel their influence, we realize them to be the essence of their
individuality, and yet we fail to catch and master them; while there
are other persons we meet whose eccentricities flare out at us in a
moment, and illuminate a character more fully and faithfully than any
words.</p>

<p>The pouting lip, the flickering eyelid, the shrug, the drumming
on the table with the fingers, the stroking of nose or chin, the revolving
of thumbs, the pushing or patting of the hair, are eloquent signs that
he who runs may read, and make his own. These may be called ostentatious
mannerisms.</p>

<p>The subtle peculiarities are far more difficult to catch and convey
faithfully. One man suddenly narrows his eyes and looks introspectively
at you, or the mouth clinches unexpectedly over the teeth without
any apparent reason. A pulse suddenly quivers into sight at the temples,
and is gone again. The expression falls into repose, but that very
stillness indicates a perplexing and evasive expression of temperament
and individuality that you cannot catch to your own satisfaction. You
may note coloring of hair, beard, mustache, &amp;c. You may purchase their
exact match, and find the likeness only a shell, because the essence
that lends delicate fragrance and character has escaped you, and without
it your representation, however flawless in coloring and texture,
is as unsatisfactory and unreal as the marble statue to the human face
and form.</p>

<p>Fundamental to the successful rendition of character impersonation
is the cultivation of dexterity and quickness. The dumb representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
must have all his regalia of wigs, beards, eyebrows, hats,
helmets, cloaks, &amp;c., well arranged, and within easy reach.</p>

<p>In a sense he is a conjuror&mdash;a magician. His movements must
be swift as lightning. Indecision creates a jar; a pause or bungling
spells failure. A small velvet-draped stand or table placed behind
him, and within easy reach, with each article ready in the order wished,
is essential. In the center of this should be a mirror, with a good
electric light over it, but shaded as much as possible from the audience
(<a href="#Fig4_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig4_1">

<img src="images/illo044.png" alt="" width="500" height="380" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Character impersonator&#8217;s stage table.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The stand must be draped in dark colors, so as to obtrude as
little as possible on the audience. While in preparation, all other
lights near you should be turned off, and only switched on for a
moment or two the instant you are ready. The attitude should be
struck in the dark, and this must be sure and swiftly taken, and absolutely
in keeping with the character assumed. Avoid grease paints as
far as possible.</p>

<p>A pianoforte or small orchestra playing some melody suitable to
the impersonation will prove a most valuable adjunct to the imagination
of artist and audience.</p>

<p>Avoid such hackneyed characters as Napoleon, the late Sir Henry
Irving, the German Emperor, and similar portrayals that may be witnessed
any evening at almost any vaudeville hall. An audience is<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
frequently more amused by the imitation of <i>types</i> than of individuals.</p>

<p>Although the character portrayals of the costumed and wigged impersonator
depend on wordless demonstrations between the items and
in ordinary evening dress, the artist may announce the name of the
personality to be represented, or have it worked in almanac fashion
and shown to the audience as it appears.</p>

<p>The former method, however, is quite usual, and perhaps more
suitable to drawing-room entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span></p>

<p>It may be kept in mind that this style of performance should
not be unduly long, and should never exceed twelve or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Speaking Impersonations</span></h3>

<p>Speaking impersonations are more difficult to achieve successfully,
for in them, as a rule, the artist has no regalia to depend upon. His
hair, his face, his voice, his limbs, his fingers are his only aids, but these
are more than sufficient for the talented and skilled performer. His
voice is as elastic as his features in power of mimicry.</p>

<p>He should be clean-shaven, but with a plentiful crop of hair, which
he can arrange and manipulate as he wishes with a mere twirl or pat
of the hand, and these must be sympathetic and convincing expressions
of his every movement. &#8220;There is no more expression in the back
of the hand than in the back of the head,&#8221; yet of what subtle demonstrations
is it not capable?</p>

<p>A whole epitome of human emotions may be demonstrated by the
gradual unfolding of the flexible, sensitive fingers. The first finger
raised, and intelligence and meaning begin to develop. The palms upturned,
the shoulders uplifted, and the head slightly bent, and you see
the suave helplessness typical of the Frenchman.</p>

<p>The arms flung outward, with the palms parallel, and the fingers
falling naturally, indicate sentiments of affection, welcome, and cordial
invitation. Stretched farther away, with fingers distended, and you
have entreaty, desire, passionate pleading, and supplication. The wrists
upturned, the fingers crooked, and grasping, and we see the personification
of rage and avarice, while the raising of the open hand, what horror
it indicates!</p>

<p>Yet the hand is only a part of the mechanism. Its soul is in the
eye, which combines in partnership and signifies calm, candor, liberality,
love, gentleness, meditation, resentment, boldness, defiance, wrath, and
fear, in complete accord with its dumb component.</p>

<p>The nostrils inflate in scorn, the head is proudly raised in dignity
or joy, and meekly bowed in humility; bent forward in shame, squarely
upright, with firm compressed features, for determination and will
power.</p>

<p>The artist must never be tempted to sacrifice his cultured discretion
in a portrayal. For instance, to give the cockney the musician&#8217;s hand,
or the priest the bookmaker&#8217;s wink, the sly housebreaker anxious to
escape notice the loud, boisterous guffaw of the countryman, is to be
guilty of the most insensate blunders.</p>

<p>Action and gesture should be skilled and practiced handmaidens<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
to the brain that molds the idea, and their service must be winged to
respond.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Temperament</span></h3>

<p>The psychological treatment of characters depends and is influenced
in no slight degree by temperament. The character the student is about
to study has its peculiar atmosphere of mind and body, which unconsciously
dictates and regulates its actions from head to foot. The most
important temperaments <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The optimistic temperament</i>, embracing impulsive, warm-hearted,
sanguine, easily-pleased, tender, ambitious dispositions.</p>

<p>2. <i>The pessimistic temperament</i>, embracing nervous, timid, sensitive,
overwrought, peevish, unstable, irritable, depressed, neurotic, restless,
dissatisfied, cynical, morbid, self-conscious dispositions.</p>

<p>3. <i>The artistic temperament</i>, embracing extravagant, sympathetic,
imaginative, languid, reckless, turbulent, excitable, hot-tempered, brooding
dispositions.</p>

<p>4. <i>The commercial temperament</i>, which embraces the phlegmatic,
lymphatic, enigmatic dispositions.</p>

<p>Now, the first way of approaching a new study is to consider what
characteristics it possesses, and to what class of temperament it
belongs, and, when this is decided, the student asks himself, what
gesture will be the most symbolic and eloquent of that temperament?</p>

<p>This method, conscientiously adhered to, will provide a safe and firm
groundwork for the beginner.</p>

<p>With judgment and sense, he will soon be able to place his
character in its right niche, and to plan his actions in accordance,
even if he has never seriously studied gesture. The movements of
an open-hearted, liberal man are usually large, free, and liberal.
He opens his arms widely for an embrace. He gives you his hand
in greeting warmly, and with frank, cordial pressure. His eyes
shine clear and steady below a benevolent forehead. His walk,
with its free, steady swing, is the index of his generous and kindly
disposition.</p>

<p>Now contrast him with the mean man, the usual type of which is
pinched in physical delineation, action, expression, and thought. His
hair grows sparsely on a skull, screwed as grimly to his face as the
upper section of a bicycle bell to the lower. His eye is squeezed in
a narrow slit of socket, roves backwards and forwards like a marble<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
in a puzzle-box. His mouth is withered in bitter antagonism for his
fellow-men. To catch a generous smile upon his colorless lips is to
surprise a sunbeam at midnight.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many shades in the scale between these extremes
of the very liberal man and the very mean one, and the artist
who is imitating the thrifty soul must remember the infinitesimal points
of difference which distinguish him alike from the benevolent and
avaricious.</p>

<p>And, in the wide margin of temperaments, an artist must be careful
not to label and pigeon-hole his characters as if they were bottles
of physic, for in the complex nature of one man there may be vast
contradictions, just as in many good medicines there is a minute quantity
of poison, so a disposition may be tinted with qualities not at all
worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>There are occasions when the most impulsive becomes cold and hesitating,
the most affectionate cruel, the most benevolent calculating, and
the most patient, hot-tempered and passionate.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Character and Circumstance</span></h3>

<p>The artist must never forget the important crucible of circumstances
which molds and forms each character, and sometimes is potent to
change the most optimistic temperament to one of pessimism and cynical
bitterness. Yet, while remembering this, one must probe beneath the
stamped envelope of environment to decipher the hieroglyphics of the
fettered soul inclosed.</p>

<p>One does not find the wild, untutored gestures of the stump orator
in the refined politician, nor the turbulent raving of the fanatic in the
sermon of the cultured ecclesiastic, while the expression natural to the
plebeian is such as the aristocrat never indulges.</p>

<p>There are many natures so complex as to defy all classification,
and to portray them successfully is an almost impossible matter unless
one masters the delicate mechanism of their nature. A grandfather&#8217;s
clock to outward appearance is a figured circle in a narrow wooden
case, with softly regularly-moving pendulum, but get behind that exterior
to the revolving wheels, and see what an amount of intricacies
are involved. So the man who presents a calm, self-possessed exterior
to the world, may in reality seethe with qualities not at all phlegmatic
or level-headed.</p>

<p>In conquering the technicalities of character, one must, as far as
possible, grip the crisis the personality has reached in his lifetime, and
this is one reason why a historic character is easier to grasp than one
contemporaneous. For example, he who portrays Napoleon in the flush<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
of success and victory, does not represent him as he who images him
at the end of his career&mdash;broken-hearted, alone, and in despair, suffering
the calumny and scorn of those who exhibited most faith and admiration
of his sanguinary achievements.</p>

<p>Correct attitude and pose are extremely important, and should be
carefully studied. The old man has tottering bowed knees, but the youth
stands firmly.</p>

<p>The reverberation of the interior gestures rules and gives to the
torso or trunk the inspiring grace of truth and beauty. It is only
when a soldier or sailor on duty is being represented that the artist
may stand bolt upright and move automatically. At all other times
the torso should be held with flexible ease, ready to combine with eye,
face and gesture, in the emotion and force of the impersonation. To
portray the child with mature and abandoned gesture is to present a
caricature of nature, and, in like manner, to represent the adult with
the careless gestures of the child, is to convey the impression of one
inane and undeveloped.</p>

<p>In attitude, remember the maxim of Cresollius: &#8220;Without the hand,
no eloquence.&#8221;</p>

<p>To imagine a boy stealing jam with the wild eye and hand-clawing
attitude of the miser snatching at gold is to exaggerate grossly and
confuse the human emotions, and to paint comedy as the burlesque
of tragedy. The hands are capable of such a vast amount of expression
that they have been considered &#8220;numerous and copious as words themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>While imitating characters, never be bound by the representations
of other artists you have seen. See with your own eyes, study with
your own brain, avoid that conventionality of fashion and ideas that
cripples progress. Let your maxims be your own, and, when they are
mastered, be not ashamed to demonstrate them with grand and self-reliant
originality.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER V</b><br />
THE UNIVERSAL HAT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marvels of Chapeaugraphy</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> entertainer must have felt at some time or other the need of a
short &#8220;gag&#8221; to fill up that awkward gap which so frequently occurs
between the conclusion of one long piece and the commencement of
another.</p>

<p>The mind of an audience is of a flighty nature and requires to be
kept continually amused, or it will wander into paths of boredom; and
many a good entertainment has failed for the simple reason that the
ball has not been kept rolling.</p>

<p>It is during one of these uncomfortable pauses that the Universal
Hat may be appropriately introduced, and, if worked well, it cannot
fail to gain approval.</p>

<p>You can either buy or make a Universal Hat, and as to do the
former will cost a dollar or more, whilst the latter can be done for
less than half that sum, it is well to be your own hat-maker.</p>

<p>Obtain a piece of fairly strong black felt, measuring 24 inches
square, and cut it into a ring, the diameter of the whole circle being
24 inches, with a hole in the center 7 inches across. That is all that
is required as far as the hat is concerned, and the success of your piece
will now rest entirely with yourself.</p>

<p>Arrange a screen behind which to retire, and have a good-sized
mirror, so placed that you will be able to see in a moment how your
head-dress suits. Keep a little rouge ready, as well as a burnt cork for
blacking eyebrows, making mustaches, &amp;c. Remember that quickness
is a necessity, for the smarter you are in changing your hats the more
the audience will appreciate the effect.</p>

<p>Now to give a few examples of what can be done with the universal
hat, so arranged as to give scope for any amount of ingenuity in inventing
new ideas.</p>

<p>Before beginning your show step from behind the screen, raise
the ring of felt in your hand, and exhibit it to the audience. Then
step back under cover, put the hat on your head, giving it a tilt in<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
front and a rakish tip to one side, assume a stern expression, and, if
you have a dog-whip amongst the stage properties, grasp it firmly
in your hand, and make an appearance before the spectators in the
character of Buffalo Bill. Take care always to face the audience as
in <a href="#Fig5_1">Fig. 1</a>, otherwise the top of your head will be seen through the hole
in the hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig5_1">

<img src="images/illo051.png" alt="" width="450" height="361" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Buffalo Bill.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Remember that in this, as in all the other characters, a lot&mdash;indeed,
almost everything&mdash;depends upon your expression, which should be entirely
in keeping with the person you represent. Buffalo Bill must not
wear a grin, but must appear as grimly in earnest as though he were
hastening to the relief of the Deadwood stage.</p>

<p>Another point to bear in mind, is that you must not make a long
appearance. A minute for each character is ample, and, as you
appear before your audience, announce who you are in a tone
suggestive of the person you are representing. A few remarks in
keeping with the character will greatly add to the realism of your
make-up, but let your words be like your appearances&mdash;brief and
effective.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Popular Characters</span></h3>

<p>Napoleon makes a good character to represent, and his hat
is very easily made. Draw two sides of the felt through the hole
in the center, and pull the hat firmly down about your ears, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
<a href="#Fig5_2">Fig. 2</a>. Assume a stern expression, suggestive of Waterloo, thrust
your left hand into your breast, hump your shoulders, and look
fiercely at the audience as
though you could see
Wellington at the farther
end of the room.</p>

<p>Later on in the performance
you can represent
Bonaparte&#8217;s great
antagonist by making the
hat in the same way, but
wearing it with the peak forward as in <a href="#Fig5_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>General Wolfe is another easy character to assume. His hat is
made in this way. Lay the felt ring flat on the table, lift up one side,
draw it towards you and then pass it downwards through the hole.
Pull back the piece that you have passed through the hole, in the
direction from which you took it in the first place, and you will find
it has made a hat of the shape
shown in <a href="#Fig5_4">Fig. 4</a>. When you
fit it on your head pull it firmly
down towards your ears, but
not too tightly, and the effect
will be complete. A little practice
will serve to perfect you in
making the twists necessary for
this and other hats, and patience
will soon reward you. To
heighten the resemblance to
General Wolfe, whiten your
cheeks with a little chalk and
draw them slightly in, to give
the appearance of being haggard
and wan. If you can get
a sword, point to the ceiling
with it enthusiastically, as one can imagine the General did when he
encouraged his men to climb the Heights of Abraham.</p>

<p>As a contrast to these more exalted personages, you can now
appear as the coal driver; although if you wish to increase the realism
by smearing your face into a state of suitable dirtiness with burnt
cork, it would be advisable to leave this character to the last. To
make the hat, lay your felt flat as before and draw up a piece from the
rim as was done in the case of General Wolfe. Now, instead of passing
it completely through the hole, push it only halfway through, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
it what may be called a half twist. It will then appear as in <a href="#Fig5_5">Fig. 5</a>,
ready for wear. Draw it tightly over your head, and slouch upon
the scene, putting your hand to your mouth and shrieking &#8220;Coal O!&#8221;
in a cracked voice.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>You may now appear as a priest in a biretta. Place the felt upon
the table and then draw a side from below, up through the hole, exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
the reverse way from that in which Wolfe&#8217;s hat was made. When you
have drawn it right through, bend it down and pass it up through the
hole once more, thus making two twists. It then resembles <a href="#Fig5_6">Fig. 6</a>,
and if you draw it upon your head with the broad brim flush against
the forehead, the impersonation will be striking. Tuck a little
lapel of white into the collar, raise your right hand with two fingers
extended, and face the
company with as pious
an expression as you can
assume.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>As a last example,
an effective appearance
may be made as the
famous Pied Piper of
Hamelin. Having laid
the felt flat, make a twist
from below upwards, as
you did in the former
hat&mdash;the priest&#8217;s biretta.
But for this hat only one
twist is required, so when
you have done this, the
hat will appear as in
<a href="#Fig5_7">Fig. 7</a>. You must now
put your hands in the
opening and stretch it
as wide as possible, thus
making the rolls very taut
and firm. Turn the felt
over and fit it on the head as shown in the picture. Draw your collar
up, take a tin whistle in your hand, and pipe a few notes before making
your appearance. Then slink into view with a cunning smile upon your
lips, reciting these lines from the <span class="nowrap">poem:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER VI</b><br />
NIGGER MINSTRELSY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Comical End-men</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> people imagine that a black face, a pair of large check
trousers and a rather dilapidated hat, are all that&#8217;s necessary to
make a nigger minstrel. This is, however, a great mistake, and
whosoever feels the stirring of an ambition to amuse his friends
with a nigger entertainment, must not be discouraged if he finds the
road harder than he expected. Its difficulties, however, are far from
insurmountable.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig6_1">

<img src="images/illo056.png" alt="" width="600" height="287" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Seating arrangements of nigger minstrel troupe.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>For a really successful nigger entertainment seven persons are
necessary; the interlocutor&mdash;usually known as Mr. Johnson&mdash;one bass
and one tenor singer and four &#8220;end-men.&#8221; The troupe should be
arranged as shown in <a href="#Fig6_1">Fig. 1</a>. Now, before describing what to do,
a few words as to how you should arrange yourselves will not be out
of place. The stage should be raised, if possible, to enable any
member of the audience to see the performers. Unless you are performing<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
a farce or drama, such as will be described later, a curtain
is not absolutely necessary, provided the troupe can get to the stage
without having to pass right through the assembled company.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Minstrels&#8217; &#8220;Make-up&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>As far as &#8220;make-up&#8221; is concerned, this should present no difficulty
whatever. Many barbers, and some music shops, can supply
&#8220;nigger black,&#8221; which must be rubbed into the
face and hands, after the skin has been well
washed and dried. When the performance is
over the black can easily be removed by means
of soap and hot water. To redden the lips and
enlarge the mouth, use carmine or rouge; cover
the lips and paint them to appear as though
stretching almost from ear to ear (<a href="#Fig6_2">Fig. 2</a>). Cheap
wigs can be obtained for but a small sum from
any hairdresser. Those of Mr. Johnson and the
sentimentalists should be as shown in <a href="#Fig6_3">Fig. 3</a>, while
each of the &#8220;end-men&#8221; should provide himself with
one similar to that depicted in <a href="#Fig6_4">Fig. 4</a>. The &#8220;interlocutor&#8221;
and sentimentalists usually wear ordinary evening dress, the
&#8220;end-men,&#8221; however, wearing frilled collars, cuffs and fronts, as shown
in <a href="#Fig6_5">Fig. 5</a>. A complete outfit comprising stockinette face, head, eyes,
teeth, and hat can be purchased for about $2.50.</p>

<p>Music is a necessity with a troupe, and you will accordingly require
another person to play the piano as an accompaniment to the songs
and choruses, as well as for the overture and instrumental pieces. It
is also presumed that the members of the troupe have fairly good
voices and are able to sing, not only in tune but in time with one
another.</p>

<p>In serious or sentimental songs, such as &#8220;Swanee River&#8221; and other
favorites, the &#8220;end-men&#8221; must forego their love of mirth and take
part in all solemnity, reserving their facetious behavior for a more
timely moment. After these remarks
the principal characters
in the troupe may be discussed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig6_5">

<img src="images/illo058.png" alt="" width="400" height="301" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Frilled collar, shirt front, and cuffs
used by end-man.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The interlocutor is one of
the most important persons upon
the stage. It is his duty to introduce
each number of the programme
to the audience; to be
the butt of the &#8220;end-men&#8217;s&#8221;
jokes; and to assume upon every
occasion an air of the utmost
ignorance and simplicity, that
shall prove an admirable foil
to the exuberant humor of
his companions. He must appear absolutely innocent of any idea of
the answers to the riddles and conundrums asked, and must reply
to the occasionally personal remarks of his friends with the utmost
suavity and good humor. In short, what with helping the others to
sing and keeping the ball rolling generally, Mr. Johnson is responsible,
to a large extent, for the success or failure of the entertainment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">From Failure to Success</span></h3>

<p>The &#8220;end-men,&#8221; with whom lies the task of producing most of the
fun of the nigger entertainment, must be possessed of a ready wit&mdash;able
to tide over awkward pauses, prepared with some &#8220;gag&#8221; when
the fun is beginning to flag, and capable of turning disaster into a
mighty success. From Mr. Johnson&#8217;s placid obtuseness they will be able
to draw much sport, and bandying jokes at each other&#8217;s and the interlocutor&#8217;s
expense, should keep the audience shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of jokes a note of warning may be struck.
The moment humor changes to vulgarity, it produces disgust in any
respectable audience. It is therefore well worth while to think over
the regular jokes you intend introducing into the performance, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
there be any that are in the remotest way likely to offend the feelings
of any person in the company, cut them out.</p>

<p>There is another point worth remembering in the matter of jokes.
It may seem a truism to remark that a joke should be funny, yet the
very funniest of jokes will fall flat if it is not led up to suitably. Don&#8217;t
ask Mr. Johnson a conundrum in a meek tone as though you were
requesting him to tell you the time. His immovably suave ignorance
will extract the answer from you, it is true, but the chances are ten to
one that the audience have either missed the question or will fail to see
the point of the answer.</p>

<p>Jokes should be introduced by a certain amount of patter which
serves to engage the attention of the hearers in such a way that when
the inevitable fun really comes they are perfectly prepared to appreciate
it. Books can be bought containing numbers of these jokes with the
suitable patter, and these will prove very useful to the amateur, who
must nevertheless remember that success really depends upon the way
in which he springs the joke upon the audience.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coon Songs</span></h3>

<p>And now a word about the singing. It goes without saying that
the larger the troupe and the better trained the voices, so much the
more enjoyable will be the choruses. The number of songs from which
to select is legion; the best plan is to write to some leading musical
publisher, telling him what you want. He will be only too pleased to
send his catalogue with some advice as to what will prove suitable.
Avoid any comic songs with a double or doubtful meaning, and keep
to strictly characteristic songs as far as possible. Old favorites never
fail to win applause, and are always safe to fall back upon; but do not
be too conservative&mdash;try <i>some</i> novelties.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Songs and &#8220;Gags&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>Nigger entertainments are usually divided into two parts, the first
consisting of songs and &#8220;gags,&#8221; as the short dialogues and impromptu
jokes are called, whilst the second is devoted to stump speeches and one-act
dramas or farces. So far as stump speeches are concerned, excellent
collections are published by the leading publishers of that class of
entertainment. Your bookseller will obtain a catalogue for you, and
a choice can then be made. The speeches should be very carefully
learnt by heart, together with the appropriate gestures (for which full
instructions are always given), and unceasingly practiced until you are
able to make your stump oratory bring down the house with delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
Stump speeches are the province of the &#8220;end-men,&#8221; and properly
delivered, can be relied upon to prove one of the successes of the
evening.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">One-Act Dramas</span></h3>

<p>With regard to one-act dramas and farces, a very exhaustive
catalogue can be furnished by publishers, with full instructions as to
how they should be performed. A word of advice, however, to the
intending actors. Too much care cannot be expended upon preparation
and rehearsals. Nothing will go of itself in this world, and least
of all plays and sketches; it is a fatal mistake to imagine that the
smallest drama or even &#8220;gag&#8221; will succeed by its own merits and
with only a little help from yourself. Endless trouble and care must
be taken in preparing the simplest joke, and boisterous as the fun
may prove upon the stage, it cannot be spontaneous, but must be diligently
rehearsed again and again before it can be presented to
your audience.</p>

<p>Your great object is, not to enjoy the fun yourself but to make
the others enjoy it, and if this is borne in mind, you will not only amuse
them but have a delightful time yourself. Again, never forget that
in a play one actor relies upon another to repeat the actual words of
the &#8220;book,&#8221; as cues and stage directions depend upon verbal accuracy.
Do not, therefore, introduce any novelties of your own&mdash;learn
the words and keep to them, for any original introductions on your
part may throw the whole play into disorder, exasperate the other actors
and disgust the audience.</p>

<p>To keep to the &#8220;book&#8221; is easy enough, and if you act in earnest&mdash;and
this is essential for the most comic pieces&mdash;you will find no
difficulty in sustaining your part correctly and intelligently. Do not
laugh at your own jokes, unless you are instructed to do so, but keep
a grave face and appear as though to find yourself in the most farcical
situations were a matter of everyday life.</p>

<p>To give an idea of a reasonably simple programme which shall
include a farce, the following is <span class="nowrap">suggested:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center highline4 fsize80">PART I</p>

<p><i>Overture on the piano.</i> A march.</p>

<p><i>Chorus.</i> Some song in which all voices can join.</p>

<p><i>Solo.</i> Preferably a sentimental song.</p>

<p><i>Jokes.</i> Properly led up to by an end-man.</p>

<p><i>Comic Song.</i> Also by an end-man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<p><i>Solo.</i> Another sentimental song. And so on for ten or eleven turns,
after which comes the</p>

<p><i>Interval.</i> During this the pianist can entertain the audience with
some operatic piece.</p>

<p class="center highline4 fsize80">PART II</p>

<p><i>Chorus.</i> As above.</p>

<p><i>Piano Solo.</i> Whilst this is being played the stage should be prepared
for the</p>

<p><i>Stump Speech.</i></p>

<p><i>Curtain and Piano Solo.</i> During which the stage is arranged for the</p>

<p><i>Farce.</i></p>

<p><i>Solo.</i> Sentimental song.</p>

<p><i>Finale.</i></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">This programme must, of course, be adapted to any exigencies of
time, space or other circumstances, but will serve as an example of what
<i>can</i> be done.</p>

<p>To conclude with a few hints as to the actual entertainment. If
possible, have a sufficient number of programmes printed, or carefully
and legibly written by hand, as the most tolerant audience grows restive
if it does not know &#8220;what comes next.&#8221; Distribute these, and
let one of your party make it his business to see that the company
are properly and comfortably seated. Begin punctually; if your
audience have to wait they become impatient, and as there are few
people more incapable of seeing a joke than impatient folk, it will be
to your own advantage to begin at the proper time. Be as silent as
possible behind the scenes; it is very tantalizing for the spectators
to hear a wild rushing hither and thither, hoarse whispering, and
the various signs of excitement in which they are not allowed to
participate.</p>

<p>Of course a certain amount of bustle is unavoidable, but reduce
it to a silent minimum. Do not be shy; remember in the first place
that the black hides all your blushes, and in the second place that nobody
is there to see <i>you</i>, but to see a &#8220;nigger&#8221; who is going to make them
laugh. Half of your audience have probably done the same in their
time, whilst the other half would have done so if they could; so take
heart, and show them all how really well it can be done. However well-disposed
your company may be, do not let that be any excuse for slovenliness
on your part, but let it rather incite you to work all the harder, so
that when everything is finished and the black is off your faces, the
universal opinion will be&mdash;&#8220;We would never have imagined that it could
be carried out so well!&#8221;</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER VII</b><br />
SOME SUGGESTIONS IN BLACK</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">For &#8220;Nigger Minstrels&#8221;</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the previous chapter hints have been given to enable a party of five or
more performers to give a Nigger Minstrel Entertainment. The object
of the following is to show how one or two people can contrive to amuse
their friends with a few negro performances.</p>

<p>The pieces are suitable either as items in a variety entertainment, or
as convenient &#8220;gags&#8221; to be introduced between longer entertainments
when the interest of the audience is to be sustained by some timely
diversion.</p>

<p>It might be remarked, by the way, that it is surprising how much
the effect of a joke depends upon the humor of the audience. If they
are feeling in a happy and pleasant frame of mind, the mere sight of a
comic man is sufficient to bring forth roars and shrieks of laughter.
But if a gloom or lack of interest has settled over the company, even the
comic genius of the late Dan Leno would most probably have failed to
raise a smile.</p>

<p>There are two things almost invariably associated with nigger songs&mdash;a
banjo and bones. Proficiency with both these is necessary before
attempting to give an entertainment.</p>

<p>Practice and a quick ear are indispensable for playing or even
strumming a banjo. A very little practice will enable you to strike
chords with ease, whilst a quick ear will show when they should be
played.</p>

<p>To make a successful &#8220;hit&#8221; with the &#8220;bones&#8221; is a question, more
or less, of knack.</p>

<p>A set of four bones costs about $1.00. When buying take care they
are sound, <i>i.e.</i> with no crack or flaw, and that they contain no core of
pith, as this is liable to dull the sound, rendering it quite impossible to
obtain the sharp clean click so necessary for successful rendition.</p>

<p>Having obtained your bones&mdash;a pair for each hand&mdash;you must know
how they should be held. Notice they are slightly curved, as
in <a href="#Fig7_1">Fig. 1</a>. With a pair in each hand place the ends between the first
and second and second and third fingers, the convex sides towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
each other (<a href="#Fig7_2">Fig. 2</a>). Hold No. 1 (the bone between the first and
second fingers) fairly firmly, although not so stiffly as to rob it of a
distinct spring. No. 2 (the bone between
the second and third fingers)
must be rapped up against its companion
by the action of the third and
fourth fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig7_1">

<img src="images/illo063a.png" alt="" width="400" height="116" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Curved bone used in nigger
minstrelsy.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A sharp shake of the hand will
make the bones clap together, while
if you keep the hand quivering and also work bone No. 2 vigorously
a continuous rattle is produced.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig7_2">

<img src="images/illo063b.png" alt="" width="300" height="178" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;How to hold the bones.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

bones.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>A good plan, when once you are accustomed to having the bones
between the fingers, is to hold
the hand with the knuckles
upwards, the bones pointing
to the ground, as in <a href="#Fig7_3">Fig. 3</a>.
By this means the fingers are
allowed freer play. At the
same time a better appearance
is given to the exhibition.</p>

<p>At first you will find your
rattles jerky and spasmodic, but
do not be content until you
have the bones so entirely under command that you can make a long
rattle as easily as a solitary tap,
remembering that the less exertion
you betray the better will be the
effect.</p>

<p>Your own ear will show you
how to introduce them into the
music. Do not drown the air&mdash;the
bones are only intended to
give a point, to accentuate certain
parts and not to render them inaudible.
A smart rattle may be given at the commencement of the
music and at the conclusion of the song.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Introducing Jokes</span></h3>

<p>All jokes should be introduced by a certain amount of conversational
patter between the Interlocutor and &#8220;Bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson, the interlocutor, is always a very simple-minded<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
person, unable to see any joke until it has been fairly thrown at him,
and perfectly innocent in the presence of the most obnoxious puns. He
has a certain patronizing air with his companion which only serves to
make his innate simplicity more delightful. Mr. Johnson maintains an
impassive face in the most ludicrous and trying situations by his very
matter-of-fact behavior, extracting all kinds of smart things from the
funny man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bones&#8221; is the very reverse of Mr. Johnson. He is up to all the
latest catches, full of quips and puns, is possessed of a never-failing
store of quaint experiences and remarkable stories, the most improbable
of which are gravely swallowed by Johnson. Yet the big red lips on
his broad black face must be immovable and never show the least
symptom of a smile as he recounts with stolid solemnity his marvelous
doings to his credulous friend.</p>

<p>The following dialogue is arranged for these two characters. Mr.
Johnson asks Bones all kinds of simple and apparently harmless
questions; but Mr. Bones replies with a constant succession of puns and
<span class="nowrap">jokes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> So you&#8217;ve been enjoying yourself, William, lately, I understand.
Dining out a good deal?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh yes, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;d dine with anybody.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Yes, but I&#8217;m told you dined with the Mayor last week.
Is that right?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Then I suppose you had an excellent dinner&mdash;plenty to
eat and drink. What was the menu?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Well, to tell you the truth, there was a lot of &#8217;em there, but
I don&#8217;t recollect him.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Ah, you don&#8217;t understand me. I mean what was the bill
of fare?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh, well, it was a pretty fair bill. I believe it cost him about
$300.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> No, you don&#8217;t understand me. I mean what dishes did
you have to eat?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Well, we didn&#8217;t eat any dishes.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> No, no, of course not; but what did you have to eat and
drink?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Well, I believe the first thing we had to eat was something
to drink.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> And what did you have to drink, then?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Well, it was a new soup.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> A new soup! Well, I should like to know what that was.
What was it called?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh, I don&#8217;t remember exactly what it was, but you might
mention the names of a few to help me.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Well, was it Mullagatawny?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> No, it wasn&#8217;t Multigatony.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Was it Mock Turtle?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> No, it wasn&#8217;t him.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Was it gravy?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Was it spring?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> No, it wasn&#8217;t spring, it was summer.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Well, I must give it up, William. What was it?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh, I know, it was what they call&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;shadow soup.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Oh, then, it must be a new soup. I&#8217;ve never heard of
shadow soup.</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Never heard of shadow soup?</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> No, I haven&#8217;t. I should like to taste that. How is it
made?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> I&#8217;ll tell you. You go down to the market, buy a nice chicken,
take it home, stretch a line across the yard, hang the chicken in the
middle of the line, put a nice clean pail of water under the chicken, and
when the sun comes out it casts its beautiful rays on the chicken, reflects
the shadow in the pail of water, and that&#8217;s what they call shadow soup.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Oh, you go down to the market, buy a nice chicken, take
it home, stretch a line across the yard, hang the chicken in the middle
of the line, put a nice clean pail of water under the chicken, and when
the sun comes out it casts its beautiful rays on the chicken and reflects
the shadow in the water, and that&#8217;s what they call shadow soup.</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> But, my dear sir, you&#8217;ve forgotten one of the principal
things.</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Oh, have I? What&#8217;s that?</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> What&#8217;s that? Why, supposing you have no sun?</p>

<p><i>Bones.</i> Well, then&mdash;you have no soup.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stump Speeches</span></h3>

<p>A little extra effort in the matter of make-up might be attempted
for stump speeches, for the orator should be as &#8220;seedy&#8221; as possible in
the way of costume. A tattered coat and battered hat are usually considered
essential to the character, whilst an old dilapidated umbrella, of
bulky form and shapeless proportions, is useful for brandishing at
the emotional parts or thumping as the impressive points in the speech
are reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span></p>

<p>The stump orator should deliver his speech mounted upon a rickety
chair or table, for his exaggerated endeavors to maintain his balance
will be certain to cause fun amongst the audience.</p>

<p>Having taken his position with much danger, and with a familiar
look at the spectators, the speaker may embark upon the lecture. He
should speak distinctly and slowly, pausing every now and again to
illustrate his remarks with some quip or to steady himself upon the very
rocky pulpit.</p>

<p>As an example he may take the following, which will serve for the
opening sentences of a stump speech on <span class="nowrap">&#8220;Sound&#8221;:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, and others. I have much, I have much (puts
hand in pocket as if to feel how much money he has), I say I have
much&mdash;much feeling of proudness in assembling here in large numbers
before you&mdash;me&mdash;you here dis even. The subject of my investigation
has been for many long years, that is to say early years, short years,
new years, old years, pig&#8217;s and donkey&#8217;s ears, and the rest of the
human race. I say the subject of my intellectual and not at all less
pig&#8217;s-head-a-frying lecture on the various means of communicating our
thoughts, words, title-deeds, and other chattels, such as sauce-pans,
frying-pans, umbrellas, knobbed sticks, brick-bats and bricks without
bats, I say the subject of this important question, whether it be the
pop-shopular question or whether it be unwise to mention, or otherwise
in dimension, let it be understood that previous to preparing myself
to begin&mdash;to commence, I must ask a few questions about the temperaments,
detriments out-o-debtriments, cape-abilities, cloak-abilities, hats,
caps, boots, shoes, underlinen, socks, and other kind of earthenware.
I say before I, as I said before I said &#8220;I say before&#8221;&mdash;this subject
can be clothes-properly dissolved, we will, although I say it myself,
ladies and gentlemen, I say we shall, ladies, we shall all be dead men.
(Takes pinch of snuff, wipes nose with wet part of handkerchief, wiping
off some black. Resumes dialogue.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Music for Minstrelsy</span></h3>

<p>Taking it for granted that the would-be minstrels have reasonably
good voices, the only difficulty will be &#8220;selection.&#8221; Of course a great
deal of tact is required to know what class of music is best suited to
the audience.</p>

<p>Have as much variety as possible. Do not confine yourself exclusively
to comic songs or to sentimental ditties alone. At all costs keep
your audience cheerful and amused. Too much humor is apt to
nauseate, but too much melancholy will certainly spell failure. Try to
gauge the temper of your company, and if they seem to prefer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
serious to the comic parts on your programme, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, make as
quick and effective an alteration as you can. They must be made to
appreciate you&mdash;not simply to tolerate you.</p>

<p>To have a piano accompaniment is a distinct acquisition if the voices
be of doubtful merit. For accomplished singers a banjo is quite sufficient,
but the amateur will certainly find that a friend at the piano is
very handy and reliable. This is, of course, entirely a matter of individual
taste and circumstances.</p>

<p>A very good selection of nigger dialogues, speeches, &amp;c., can be
obtained from any theatrical publisher. The entertainer will be furnished
with useful ideas for a programme, including some of the most
successful minstrels&#8217; songs and drolleries.</p>

<p>As the Stump Orator would say, &#8220;We must now draw a delusion
to our not over long lecture,&#8221; feeling confident that the amateur nigger
will find his entertainment as great a source of pleasure to himself as of
amusement to the audience.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER VIII</b><br />
TABLEAUX VIVANTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">True-to-Life Representations</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tableaux</span> may be divided into two important classes&mdash;the portrayal
of abstract qualities, which usually includes motionless figures posed
in sustained attitudes, and historic and romantic groups, in which the
actor is allowed some occupation.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig8_0a">

<img src="images/illo068a.png" alt="" width="297" height="550" />

<p class="caption">The Hero.</p>

<div class="right5050">

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig8_0b">

<p class="caption">The Martyr.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span></p>

<p>The first class is most difficult of successful achievement. In it,
the whole gamut of emotions common to mankind may be symbolized,
and in these attitude and gesture are governed by the mind, which
should be revealed in every muscle, curve, and limb of the human
frame.</p>

<div class="split3367">

<div class="left3367">

<div class="figcenter w180" id="Fig8_0c">

<img src="images/illo069a.png" alt="" width="176" height="531" />

<p class="caption">The Ascetic.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--left3367-->

<div class="right3367">

<div class="figcenter w360" id="Fig8_0d">

<img src="images/illo069b.png" alt="" width="358" height="531" />

<p class="caption">The Fanatic.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right3367-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split3367-->

<p>Strength, courage, fidelity, chivalry, purity, and honesty should be
posed in such a manner that the simple grandeur and dignity of these
attributes cannot be mistaken. The hero, the martyr, the ascetic, the
fanatic have each a commonly recognized type and pose.</p>

<p>The shrinking form of the coward&mdash;he who fears all things greater
than himself&mdash;must bear the stamp of the puny soul unveiled. The
eye of the hypocrite, the cunning, the evil and degraded, is as different
from the gaze of the pure of heart as the muddy, stagnant pool is
different from the wide, blue expanse of salt sea&mdash;the air of a foul room
from the breath inhaled beneath the open sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

<p>And in the same way that grand music is expressive of all human
emotions, and as welcome to the ear as the song of birds, so form and
color, attitude and character, in living pictures are potent emblems of
the strength and weakness of complex humanity.</p>

<p>The figure that is to symbolize Hope must possess that wondrous
attribute in herself, otherwise no trickery of dress or limelight can make
her anything but a caricature of the spirit of optimism.</p>

<p>So that, in order to portray virtues and vices as they are, the stage
manager&#8217;s craft reaches beyond superficial knowledge. Psychology and
intuition are even more important to him than experience regarding
blending of colors, arrangement of lights and grouping of forms, for
the human mind is the keynote in which his music is revealed, the
touchstone of his secret, the mystic spirit dominating the symmetry of
gesture.</p>

<p>In the choice of individuals, personal character is weighty&mdash;pink
and white flesh tints, however perfectly blended in a face, do not stand
for Patience, Charity, or Sympathy unless the heart behind is pulsed
on the pivot-springs of these virtues, for the experienced eye of the
spectator probes beyond paint and attitude, and knows perfectly well
whether these virtues are rightly embodied or merely distorted
mimicry.</p>

<p>Therefore the stage manager of tableaux vivants, before all else,
needs penetration in recognizing and choosing exponents suitable to
interpret the abstract conditions he is anxious to depict, and it is only
when his choice is made that the training, grouping, and scenic effects
need be considered.</p>

<p>Tableaux vivants are in character not unlike a symphony. The
theme in both is important. In the latter, the interweaving of other
parts enhances the beauty of the dominating strain, as in the former,
where harmonizing colors and stage effects, important as they are, remain
ever subordinate to the principal conception aspired.</p>

<p>Of course, in the training of subjects, it is very necessary that one
attitude should be maintained by each figure and remain unbroken from
the lift to the fall of the curtain, and this without rigidity of
body, unless the characteristic is typified in rigid lines; but even
more important is the necessity that the mind should not waver nor
the features change to an expression not in harmony with the attribute
typified.</p>

<p>Hope does not frown or smile, and all nervous twitching is absent
from the tranquil face and figure of Serenity. Courage shows a lofty
brow and steady eye&mdash;the shoulders are squared resolutely, but not
aggressively.</p>

<p>Mercy, Pity, Love, Gentleness, Sweetness, and Charity are most<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
perfectly imaged by women, who naturally possess these virtues; Dignity,
Determination, Steadfastness, and Chivalry by men. But the stage
manager need not limit himself by any conventions in this particular,
for it sometimes happens that a woman&#8217;s face and form breathe characteristics
usually found in certain types of manhood, while a man&#8217;s
countenance may be eloquent of the gentle virtues typical of
womanhood.</p>

<p>The thoughts of each character must be concentrated on the
part undertaken, and the onlookers absolutely forgotten. As far
as possible the actors should forget that there is a certain amount
of strain in the immovable pose, otherwise limbs will twitch and the
balance and pose be in peril. With sufficient practice it will not be
difficult to remain in the attitude fixed upon for the few minutes
after the curtain is lifted. It is only at first that the limbs, either through
inexperience or nervousness, prove rebellious. The impersonators should
not be afraid to breathe regularly, for this prevents artificial
rigidity.</p>

<p>Figures should not be crowded together. A small stage, such as
would be used in a drawing-room, requires a picture in proportion.
The dresses and lights should blend harmoniously with the background
and frame.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Staging</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Fig8_1">Fig. 1</a> depicts the lighting arrangement at back of frame. The
guard-wires, running from side to side, are to prevent the possibility
of dresses catching fire. The footlights usually consist of ordinary
night-lights with illumination glass covers. Behind these are tin shades
for reflectors. Electric light, if available, can be substituted for oil
lamps as shown. In the same sketch a curtain-raising apparatus also
appears. Two persons should be chosen for its manipulation, and be
always stationed in such a position that they can draw and divide the
curtain at the given signal.</p>

<p>Every separate production is timed by the stage manager or some
other reliable person, and the duration of each should be exact. Three,
or at the most four, minutes are ample time for the audience to take
in the details of the picture, and the instant the curtain is drawn another
group is arranged, the actors being perfectly familiar with the
position and pose they are to take, going to their places without confusion
or disorder.</p>

<p>In a succession of group-pictures different groups of actors are
necessary, for it is impossible for the same persons to change their
costumes in the minute or so that intervenes before the succeeding
spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span></p>

<p>Where the number of players amounts to fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five,
the number of tableaux arranged upon can be divided between
them, and the productions, consisting of from two to five figures, arranged
in such a way that during group A&#8217;s tableaux group B is ready
in the wings and takes the stage the instant group A disappears through
a different exit to the dressing-room. Next, group C takes group B&#8217;s
place in the wings, and so on with all the groups. In this way each has
a few minutes in which to change.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig8_1">

<img src="images/illo072.png" alt="" width="600" height="569" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Lighting arrangement for back of frame.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Confusion and fussing will be prevented by each group knowing
exactly their manner and mode of entrance. Some plan, which
renders it impossible for group A leaving the stage to collide with
group B in the wings, must be fixed upon. Because the tableaux take<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
place in a strange drawing-room, where there is not much accommodation
possible behind the platform, and few entrances and exits, is no
adequate excuse for any bungling or confusion.</p>

<p>However limited the space, the stage manager and his company
should hit upon some plan that makes for order and precision. To do
this, the performers should come early to rehearse entrances and exits,
and then memorize them, for any mistake behind the scene, even if
of so slight a character that it does not retard the productions, is apt
to disturb the nerves of the players, and rob them of their necessary
calm.</p>

<p>There should be no laughing or talking, for sounds easily penetrate
through a drawing-room, and not only disturb the audience, but draw
from their task the attention of the group occupying the stage.</p>

<p>The stage manager, who feels unable to represent abstract qualities
perfectly, would do well to avoid them altogether.</p>

<p>It may happen that his actors include a few who are absolutely raw
material where tableaux are concerned, and upon such occasions he
should always have a few studies in his repertoire in which motionless
poses are not necessary.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Penelope and Ulysses</span></h3>

<p>For example, a pretty novice, sitting at a spinning-wheel, weaving
imaginary threads from a spindle of flax, will do very well as Penelope,
spinning her endless garment during the absence of Ulysses. In a
simple white or colored gown, with her hair falling over her shoulders,
and her head bent slightly over the wheel, she makes a pleasing
picture.</p>

<p>Cinderella, seated on the floor, gazing into the cinders, with her hands
clasped round her knees, is another quite easily adopted attitude.</p>

<p>Another pretty scene, acted over the spinning-wheel, is the Lady of
Shalott, weaving &#8220;a magic web with colors gay,&#8221; and peering from
time to time at the mirror above her, which reflects &#8220;the highway near,
winding down to Camelot.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this tableau the facial expression is wholly different from that
which dominates Penelope&#8217;s features. Penelope&#8217;s labor is inspired by
stratagem, to keep her unwelcome suitors at bay. Her soul is steeped
in a patience so melancholy that it verges on despair, whereas the Lady
of Shalott &#8220;weaves by night and day,&#8221; because she believes she is
chained to her task by an awful power. If she pauses a moment, a
curse will fall upon her. Her eyes, therefore, are wild with fear, her
face contorted, her fingers pluck the threads feverishly, and there is
none of Penelope&#8217;s listlessness in her wild agonized concentration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>History and fiction teem with incidents that can be easily translated
into groups, wherein an absolutely motionless attitude is not required.</p>

<p>The three witches in &#8220;Macbeth,&#8221; in their cone-shaped hats, tattered
rags, and disheveled hair, their wild, evil prophecy, seared in the deep
lines of their withered faces, haunched on the ground conspiring
together.</p>

<p>Guinevere, prone on the convent floor of &#8220;the holy house at Almesbury&#8221;;
King Arthur, fully armed, and stained with battle, bending
over her in agonized tenderness, pity, and shame; and many other
examples, which will
easily be found by the
stage manager, ambitious
to exhibit pictures
more unique than those
usually adopted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stage &#8220;Props&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>The materials used
for characters need not
be expensive or difficult
to procure. Cheap
sateens, muslins, velveteens,
gold paper
pasted over cardboard
and large buttons,
glass diamonds and
emeralds, tinsel and silver
braid, bright-colored
ribbons from the
remnant basket, discarded shoes and stockings, transformed by cheap
dyes, vari-colored beads, imitation ermines, tin swords and armor&mdash;all
these are useful and effective beneath the lime-light.</p>

<p>Backgrounds may be arranged by means of curtains draped over
the walls in colors that blend or contrast harmoniously as desired
with the tableau produced. Properties, such as old wine flagons,
lamps, &amp;c., may be fashioned by means of cardboard, cut in the
necessary shape, gummed together, and covered with gold or silver
paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig8_2">

<img src="images/illo074.png" alt="" width="500" height="479" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Tiers for back-stage grouping.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Fancy dress magazines and illustrated histories will reveal many
secrets to the stage manager. Better still, a visit to a museum, when
he is in doubt about the shape and period of some article he requires,
and observation of the properties utilized in historic or Shakespearean<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
plays will well repay time and trouble spent. Duplicates in lead, wood,
or tin of almost any old article can be fashioned well enough to answer
his purpose.</p>

<p>When a large group of figures is to be arranged, light wooden ladders,
placed in a semicircle, and covered with some appropriate color,
make easy and adaptable tiers, on each step of which a figure is posed,
or an arrangement of tiers for back-stage grouping can be made as
shown in <a href="#Fig8_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The most expensive aids in the stage manager&#8217;s paraphernalia&mdash;and
these, alas, there is no overcoming&mdash;are the supply of the lime-light
and the loan of the wigs. But in this direction he should not be too
ambitious, contenting himself at the start with a moderate outfit in
accordance with his means and inexperience.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER IX</b><br />
CHARADES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Old Favorite for Indoor Parties</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most popular indoor entertainments for winter evenings, or
indoor parties, both with children and &#8220;grown-ups,&#8221; is charades. Not
only do they afford amusement to the audience, but the players themselves
obtain a good deal of fun from their efforts to baffle those who
are listening to them.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that a &#8220;party&#8221; is composed of some twenty
people. About five or six of them are selected to go outside, choose a
word, which can easily be split into syllables, each making a word in
itself.</p>

<p>The players must not waste too much time in planning how best to
act the words, or the audience will show signs of impatience. This can
also be averted by the hostess arranging for a musical, or other little
&#8220;stop-gap&#8221; to fill up the time which must necessarily elapse between
the moment when the players retire and their subsequent
appearance.</p>

<p>Having thought of a little sketch which will take in all the several
parts of the word chosen, the players arrange impromptu scenery and
start the first act, taking care to bring in the first syllable, and yet not
giving it undue prominence. This care must be observed all the way
through the charade, as the fun is much greater when the listeners cannot
guess the word too easily.</p>

<p>If the word chosen is &#8220;Indignation,&#8221; it is split into three syllables&mdash;<span class="smcap">In</span>,
<span class="smcap">dig</span>, <span class="smcap">nation</span>.</p>

<p>These words having been acted, in the last scene the complete word
is brought in, and as it is through this act the audience will listen most
carefully for a clew, the players, if they wish to baffle them, should do
their best to bring in a variety of words in order to mislead the
listeners.</p>

<p>In many cases a little scenery adds considerably to the successful presentation
of charades. A &#8220;window&#8221; frequently proves of service.
But it may happen that the end of the room where the actual window
is situated does not lend itself conveniently to the performance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
charade, and in this circumstance
the best plan
is to improvise an &#8220;artificial
window,&#8221; which, being
portable, can be used in
any required position.</p>

<h3 id="Ref3"><span class="smcap">An &#8220;Artificial
Window&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>A start can be made in
construction by procuring
a sheet of strong white
paper of the requisite size.
With India ink or chalk
the thick black lines, as
shown in <a href="#Fig9_1">Fig. 1</a>, are painted
in. The dotted lines represent
the sheet of paper, the
four holes the positions at
which the nails fasten it to
the wall, and the finished
effect of an interior window
is obtained by the draping
of art muslin or curtains, as
suggested by the diagram.</p>

<p>Oftentimes a little exterior scene is wanted. A simple way of
improvising a cottage is that
of using two screens placed
as shown (A, A, <a href="#Fig9_2">Fig. 2</a>).
A plank or the shelf of a
cupboard is placed across
the top (D, <a href="#Fig9_2">Fig. 2</a>), and kept
in position either by nails or
gimlets screwed into the top
of the screens.</p>

<p>A tablecloth of any bright
color, preferably red, is
stretched from points (B, B,
<a href="#Fig9_3">Fig. 3</a>), slanting downwards
and slightly over the edge of
the screens.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig9_1">

<img src="images/illo077a.png" alt="" width="340" height="450" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Interior artificial window for charades.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Two &#8220;artificial windows&#8221; (C, C, <a href="#Fig9_3">Fig. 3</a>)
should be then pinned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
the screens, and the exterior of cottage is complete, an additional artistic
effect being produced by fixing
flower-stands with ferns in positions
as shown (E, E, <a href="#Fig9_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3>&#8220;<span class="smcap">A Seaside Scene</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>At first sight it might seem
out of the question to produce
a really passable scene representing
&#8220;the rolling deep.&#8221;
This may be easily carried
out, however, by a careful
study of <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>, and the requisitioning
of such commonplace
articles as a large white
sheet, which is stretched and
nailed to the wall, a few rolls
of stout white-backed wall-paper,
hassocks, boxes, and
old brown or gray cloths.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig9_4">

<img src="images/illo078b.png" alt="" width="600" height="394" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;A sea scene.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The wall-paper is cut into three lengths corresponding with the
width of the sheet, one about 18 inches in depth (A, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>), the next
28 inches (B, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>), and the third 34 inches (C, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>At each end a piece of wood is fastened (D, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>), behind which
is glued a block of wood or small weighted box (E, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>The lengths of paper, marked A and B, are cut in zig-zag fashion at
the top in order to produce the appearance of waves, the effect being
enhanced by an application of blue paint used as shown in the <a href="#Fig9_4">diagram</a>.
The strip of paper marked C forms the horizon, therefore the top of this
should be left straight and painted blue to a depth of about 10 inches.</p>

<p>To complete the effect, boxes, hassocks, and stools of different
heights are grouped round and covered with the gray cloths to represent
rocks (F, F, <a href="#Fig9_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>An empty barrel and a few coils of rope flung carelessly about help
to make a more realistic scene, and well guarded lamps placed between
the slips representing waves throw them up into necessary prominence.</p>

<h3 id="Ref2"><span class="smcap">A Portable Tent</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig9_5">

<img src="images/illo079.png" alt="" width="600" height="546" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;A portable tent.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A portable tent is made from a few sheets of brown paper glued
together to form a huge square (A, A, A, A, <a href="#Fig9_5">Fig. 5</a>), the paper cut out<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
to the shape described (B, B, B, B, <a href="#Fig9_5">Fig. 5</a>), and folded at the dotted
lines, C, C, C, C.</p>

<p>The whole is then arranged over three poles, crossed and tied together
at the top, an opening or entrance being formed by the segment
cut away.</p>

<h3 id="Ref1"><span class="smcap">Outfit for Highwayman</span></h3>

<p>A highwayman&#8217;s mask will prove easy of construction, and a thing
of delight to the average boy. Moreover, it will often find a place in
charades.</p>

<div class="split4060">

<div class="left4060">

<div class="figcenter w230" id="Fig9_6">

<img src="images/illo080a.png" alt="" width="229" height="303" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;A highwayman&#8217;s mask.</p>

<div class="right4060">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Highwayman&#8217;s leggings.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right4060-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

<p>On a width of black sateen or any other suitable material a design
is drawn as shown in <a href="#Fig9_6">Fig. 6</a>, marked with chalk and cut away to fit the
face. A piece of thin black tape is fixed to either side, so that the mask
may be tied round the head just above the ears.</p>

<p>Amongst the highwayman&#8217;s outfit there
must certainly be a pair of high boots, but as
these are not found in every household, it may
be as well to give a few simple directions for
the making of them.</p>

<p>From several sheets of stout brown paper
four pieces of the shape indicated at (A, <a href="#Fig9_7">Fig. 7</a>),
are cut. So that the tops of the boot shall not
crack when the leg is bent, small pieces of paper
are gummed at either side, as shown (B, <a href="#Fig9_7">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p>Only the fixing of a piece of tape, or double fold of the paper for
the instep, remains to be done (C, <a href="#Fig9_7">Fig. 7</a>), and an excellent pair of
highwayman&#8217;s boots is to hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig9_8">

<img src="images/illo080c.png" alt="" width="300" height="267" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Highwayman&#8217;s hat.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span></p>

<p>An ordinary pliable felt or straw hat can be easily and quickly
transformed into a three-cornered highwayman&#8217;s hat. A study of <a href="#Fig9_8">Fig. 8</a>
will explain where the stitches are to be taken from the brim to the
crown.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Policeman&#8217;s Helmet</span></h3>

<p>Two hard felt derby hats properly treated make an excellent representation
of a policeman&#8217;s helmet, which will very often be found useful
for charade acting.</p>

<p>It is first of all necessary
to cut off the brim
of one of the hats at the
point where the band
comes. The crown of
the second one is also
cut off, but some three
inches above the band.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig9_9">

<img src="images/illo081a.png" alt="" width="389" height="178" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;Front and back view of a policeman&#8217;s helmet.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The first crown is
next carefully fitted over the brim portion of the other one, and tacked
round firmly so that the two pieces do not slip.</p>

<p>The headgear now presents the appearance of an abnormally high
derby hat.</p>

<p>The curved part
of the brim is cut
away, and the front
shaped to a point,
as shown in <a href="#Fig9_9">Fig. 9</a>,
and the brim at
the back is nicely
rounded.</p>

<p>The usual ornamentation
may be
suggested by the
application of chalk,
the addition of a
large-sized wooden
button mold glued
to the top of the crown, a chin-strap of shiny black leather completing
the article.</p>

<div class="figcenter w430" id="Fig9_10">

<img src="images/illo081b.png" alt="" width="428" height="303" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;Skull cap, pigtail, and hat for Chinaman.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Chinaman&#8217;s Head Covering</span></h3>

<p>A Chinaman is a character quite easily portrayed, and one which can
be simply represented by pressing into service articles of everyday use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<p>From a piece of pale pink sateen the head covering (A, <a href="#Fig9_10">Fig. 10</a>)
is fashioned, a string run through at C to be drawn out or in at will;
and a piece of rope or twist of darning cotton, B, sewn on at the back
for a pigtail.</p>

<p>Then if the would-be Chinaman wishes to cover his head still further,
the lid of the linen basket provides him with a hat, when a piece of braid
or black paper has been fixed to the rim, and a string sewn on for the
chin-strap.</p>

<p>A highly-colored dressing jacket and a pair of rather loose white
trousers complete the Chinaman&#8217;s outfit.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Advertisement Charades</span></h3>

<p>Whilst some people consider the ordinary charades the best fun,
there are others equally ready to admit that they prefer the &#8220;dumb&#8221;
representation of words chosen, one of the most popular of these being
the &#8220;advertisement&#8221; charade, wherein some well-known poster is chosen
and acted in silence.</p>

<p>A well-known soap advertisement which has been so popular for
years serves as an excellent illustration. There are few, if any, who
could not recall the picture.</p>

<p>A man, dirty of face and hands, with torn clothing, sits at a table
writing a letter.</p>

<p>A faithful representation of this can be easily produced by the aid
of soot smeared carefully over the face and hands, and a wig of tousled
hair.</p>

<p>Perhaps a dozen advertisements can be &#8220;played,&#8221; a few moments
elapsing between each for the audience to write down their &#8220;guesses&#8221;
on slips of paper, which are afterwards collected, and a prize awarded to
the competitor who has the largest number of answers correct.</p>

<p>The two following examples of charades are given so that the
players may fit in their own words. If the charades need to be written
in dialogue form and committed to memory days before they are played,
much more trouble is given, and the game becomes a somewhat irksome
one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baronetcy</span><br />
[BARON-ATE(ET)-CY(SEA).]</h3>

<h4 class="highline"><i>First Syllable.</i><br />
BARON.</h4>

<p>Enter two boys dressed as highwaymen. For this purpose art
muslin scarves tied round the waist, hats and masks as already<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
<a href="#Ref1">described</a>, and toy pistols are enough, with a scenery of trees painted
on some stout paper.</p>

<p>First boy addresses his comrade in tones of mystery, glancing to
right and left as though he is expecting somebody. At length he holds
up a warning finger: &#8220;Hist! The Baron comes this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>They secrete themselves and wait until the Baron approaches. He
looks round, whereupon the two highwaymen jump out, secure him,
and make off.</p>

<p>The Baron&#8217;s servants arrive on the scene too late, but vow they will
track the robbers, and start off in hot pursuit.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><i>End of First Act.</i></p>

<h4 class="highline"><i>Second Syllable.</i><br />
ATE-(ET).</h4>

<p>Baron asleep in one corner of a tent (made as previously <a href="#Ref2">described</a>).</p>

<p>The robbers are eating their dinner, and talking in low tones of the
ransom they expect to get for their prisoner. Whilst they are talking
the Baron awakes. They are so intent upon their conversation that
they do not observe him arise, creep up, and steal their food. He
eats it, and returns to his corner again.</p>

<p>The ruffians discover their food is gone and are furious, but do
not suspect their prisoner, who they suppose is still slumbering.</p>

<p>The Baron is so amused at their efforts to find the thief that he
begins to laugh, rocking himself to and fro, and at last shouts, &#8220;I ate
it, I ate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as they are about to flog him a noise of tramping feet is heard,
and they hasten to see who is coming.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><i>End of Second Act.</i></p>

<h4 class="highline"><i>Third Syllable.</i><br />
SEA-(CY).</h4>

<p>Baron and his faithful retainers are sitting by the seashore, and he
is telling them how he made his escape from the robbers.</p>

<p>As they are talking an old beggar comes along. The Baron at once
recognizes him as one of the robbers, and gives orders that he is to be
seized and bound. Presently the other one arrives, and he is treated
in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span></p>

<p>Finally the Baron promises to forgive them if they will give up
highway robbery and go to sea.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><i>End of Third Act.</i></p>

<h4 class="highline"><span class="smcap">Baronetcy</span></h4>

<p>Enter several boys in ragged clothes as newsboys. They are shouting
papers for sale, and the chief thing that can be heard is &#8220;Extry&mdash;Capture
of a Baron at Sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys discuss the news, and at last one of them bursts into a
fit of laughter after having opened the paper. The others crowd round
to see what is causing the merriment.</p>

<p>Laughingly he explains that it is not an account of an exciting
piratical affair, but merely the report of the capture of a Baronetcy in
England by a fair cousin from the United States.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beanstalk</span></h3>

<h4 class="highline"><i>First Syllable.</i><br />
BEAN.</h4>

<p class="hind02"><i>Scene.</i>&mdash;Widow Frankey&#8217;s kitchen. Representation of this made by
use of window described <a href="#Ref3">above</a>, kitchen table and chairs, plates,
pastry board, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="ind24">Widow Frankey, in apron and cap, is busy making pastry,
and talking to herself about her son Jack, and wondering when
he will return from the errand on which she has sent him.</p>

<p class="ind24">Jack appears. Tells his mother where he has been, and she
scolds him for being so slow.</p>

<p class="ind24">He goes out in a temper, and Widow Frankey leaves her work,
sits down and cries, finally falling asleep.</p>

<p class="ind24">Jack returns, finds his mother asleep, and determines to make
up for his ill-temper by finishing the pudding she has already
begun.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">(An amusing scene can be shown here by the funny mistakes he
makes, putting into the pudding all kinds of odd ingredients, amongst
them a bean.)</p>

<p class="ind24 blankbefore75">His mother awakes, to find dinner set, and ready.</p>

<p class="ind24">There is great fun over the pudding when the widow finds
the bean.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><i>End of First Act.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span></p>

<h4 class="highline"><i>Second Syllable.</i><br />
STALK.</h4>

<p class="hind02"><i>Scene.</i>&mdash;Corner of market-place, where a flower-seller has her stall.
For this purpose a table, draped with art muslin, with a few pots
of ferns on it, and some flowers made from tissue paper, will be
all that is required.</p>

<p class="ind24">Girl sits on a stool doing up bunches of flowers.</p>

<p class="ind24">Jack comes along running, and in his hurry knocks the table
over.</p>

<p class="ind24">Flower-seller pretends to be very angry, and insists upon Jack&#8217;s
paying for the damage.</p>

<p class="ind24">He does so, and the girl laughingly gives him the stalk of a
flower for fun. He puts it in his button-hole and walks off, leaving
the girl laughing.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><i>End of Second Act.</i></p>

<h4 class="highline">BEANSTALK</h4>

<p class="hind02"><i>Scene.</i>&mdash;Widow Frankey&#8217;s kitchen.</p>

<p class="ind24">Jack returns to his home, and tells his mother of his escapade,
showing her the stalk which the flower-girl had given him.</p>

<p class="ind24">Just then the door opens, and the flower-girl enters, throws Jack&#8217;s
money on the table, telling him she took it only for a joke. He returns
the stalk to the girl, who laughingly tells him that it is a beanstalk.</p>

<p class="ind24">Widow Frankey retires, and Jack tells the pretty flower-girl that
he loves her.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER X</b><br />
THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE MUSICAL SKETCH</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> musical sketch occupies a high and prominent position in the
scale of entertainments given by the individual. With many it is
more popular than ventriloquism, impersonations, reciting, or conjuring,
and needs as much skill and study as any of these other
accomplishments. For its successful rendition the artist must be
equipped with</p>

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="noindent blankbefore75">1. Subtle humor and pathos.<br />
2. Impromptu patter.<br />
3. A good memory.<br />
4. A clear pronunciation.<br />
5. Mimicry.<br />
6. Self-accompaniment from memory.<br />
7. Individuality and mastery of the audience.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="blankbefore75">He must also be well versed in the popular topics of the day, and
be able to dish them up in an attractive manner to suit the humor of
his various hearers; and, of course, a certain amount of natural talent
is indispensable.</p>

<p>In this mode of entertainment there should be no pause. The whole
time the artist should either be engaged in patter or playing, and he
must go from anecdote to anecdote smoothly and without jerkiness,
always relating his stories as if they were his own experiences.</p>

<p>He should begin an after-dinner story in some such way <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The other night, when dining with my friend, Mr. A., I had the
misfortune to be stuck down beside his elderly maiden aunt, Miss
Dimbledock, who my host had previously informed me was a
stanch adherent to the Blue Ribbon Army. Now, as Mr. A. is her
only living relative, he naturally expected to inherit her wealth, and
consequently had given instructions to Coggledab, the butler (who
on ordinary occasions served as coachman), that especial attention
and care were to be lavished upon her severe and abstemious person;
but, alas, he had forgotten to instill him with her principles, and the
result was that the poor old lady was mortally offended, for, ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
we had reached the second course, Coggledab leaned over her chair
in a fatherly and solicitous manner that well became his white hairs
and portly person, and whispered in a voice that penetrated every corner
of the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gin, whisky, or brandy, Mum? You can&#8217;t be enjyin&#8217; of yourself!
<i>You&#8217;re not drinkin&#8217;!</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is to this apparently trivial incident that a year ago a
flourishing dogs&#8217; home was opened in New York, and that my poor
friend Mr. A. can be seen any day selling matches at his post in Times
Square! And talking of the importance of trivialities, reminds me of
an adventure that befell me the other day. I had hired a taxi-cab,
and was just stepping into it&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; &amp;c., &amp;c., thus introducing quite a
different anecdote.</p>

<p>Now, the outlines of the incident of Mr. A.&#8217;s dinner-party are
taken from a comic paper, but twisted and colored to suit the requirements
of the artist; and there are many stories that may be dished up
in similar manner, while frequently personal experiences are extremely
humorous when rightly treated.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;All in All&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>The artist should study and cultivate the correct and various methods
of telling a story, remembering Pope&#8217;s <span class="nowrap">adage&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;For style is all in all, whate&#8217;er is writ,<br /></span>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>If the style of writing is important, how much more is the manner
of verbal narration. The wittiest story may fall to pieces in the hand
of the inartistic, while the most trivial incident humorously handled may
be greeted with shrieks of merriment.</p>

<p>The raconteur must give his audience the impression of frank geniality
and friendliness without familiarity, his attitude cunningly eloquent
of the man who is about to open his heart to a confidante.</p>

<p>Orchestra chairs and gallery are his bosom friends. He twinkles and
patters at them right merrily. If he paints their peculiarities or laughs at
their social ways he must flavor his babbling with the tender fun
of that greatest of humorists, Charles Lamb, who never aped or
scoffed at physical deformity, and was never cynical at another&#8217;s
expense.</p>

<p>The caricatures depicted by mimicry must be cleansed of that
sour Voltaire bitterness and cruelty, the artist always remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
that he is performing in order to beguile, and he must cultivate that
delicate tact which prevents him from imitating the withered idiosyncrasies
supposed to be typical of the old maid in the drawing-room,
when he knows that some spinster relative or friend is present.</p>

<p>The public possesses a vast fund of humor, and there is nothing
it loves so much as a hearty laugh, but its risibilities should be
handled as delicately as a trout is tickled, and if they are only
provoked at the dear expense of some unfortunate individual, they
are coarse and vulgar, and the artist himself is culpable. The broad
double meanings of apparently innocent witticisms one might have
heard at some vaudeville halls should be rigorously avoided. There
are gentlemen, fine-souled and clean of mind, in your gallery as in
your orchestra chairs. Treat them as such. Appeal to the best, to
the refined sense of the ludicrous that lurks in every mind, and you
will be as welcome in the most select drawing-room as in the
theater.</p>

<p>Humor and fun are as bracing and purifying a tonic as a breath
of sea air. They should be steeped in the salt ozone of wit, but never
in the withering blight of vulgarity.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Artist&mdash;and a Gentleman</span></h3>

<p>The artist should be large-souled and natural in attitude and gesture&mdash;a
gentleman from head to heel in the best sense of the word&mdash;and
the result will brace up and encourage him, for he will observe
the faded city merchant laughing with the heart-whole abandon of the
child.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, and it may become even monotonous, to pose
forever as the comedian who sees fun in every incident around him.
A great and versatile artist, now deceased, in the middle of his recital
would sit down at the zither when the room was still ringing with
laughter, provoked by his keen shafts of humor, and win tears by the
exquisite pathos of the refrain: &#8220;The mill will never grind with the
water that is past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maudlin melodrama is not pathos any more than vulgar mockery
is humor. A thin veil lies between tears and laughter, and both are
nearer the surface than some artists realize. Both are noble and wholesome,
and so should never be made puny by too little giving or rendered
grotesque by too much.</p>

<p>A most effective means of self-accompaniment is the harp, and one
moreover which adapts itself exquisitely to the subtle charm and changing
qualities of the human voice, but only in the performer&#8217;s
more serious moments. To twang at this instrument and pose above<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
it in the attitude of the comedian, to pluck it banjo fashion, is to
displease and jar the sensibilities of the most uninitiated of the
audience.</p>

<p>The dual art is a stumbling-block to many a versatile artist, and
its perfection needs a tremendous amount of persevering and diligent
practice. There are some gifted performers to whom the art of pattering
or reciting to music is inborn, and so extremely facile, but to the
less fortunate it presents discouraging obstacles, and the power of improvising
an accompaniment suitable to the anecdote or poem related is
not given to the majority.</p>

<p>However, the student should remember and be encouraged by the
fact that &#8220;steady effort attracts unknown powers to our aid,&#8221; and work
on determinedly until the difficulty is mastered.</p>

<p>In studying the dual art, the beginner is apt to hammer the words
to the accompaniment, or the accompaniment to the words, and it seems
at first impossible to arrive at that perfect blending of voice and music
which is essential to this kind of performance. Another extremely
common fault is to emphasize the wrong word or the wrong note, with
the result that the achievement becomes meaningless.</p>

<p>The ear should be trained to the r&ocirc;le of an exacting critic, and when
this power is developed it will demonstrate faithfully wherein the failure
of co-operation lies.</p>

<p>Music should never be suffered to overburden the words of the poem
or anecdote related. It is usually but a ground-work upon which the
artist builds, &#8220;at most, an undercurrent of answering emotion.&#8221; The
instant it flows through the floodgates of restraint it obliterates the
meaning and the sense of the words as the waters of a burst dam obliterate
the natural features of dry land.</p>

<p>Another serious fault to be found in the rendition of the inexperienced
student is permitting the time of his accompaniment to swing into
his voice. Against this he must be severely on his guard, or he will
develop a wearisome habit of chanting in monotone.</p>

<p>While taking pains to blend his voice with his accompaniment, he
must take equal care to keep both distinct and apart. This sounds paradoxical,
but practice and self-criticism will prove that both are true
and possible.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Music and Words</span></h3>

<p>The speaker should learn to harmonize his music so exquisitely with
his words that to the uninitiated the accompaniment seems rather extempore
improvising than the result of toil and diligence. As a
matter of fact, it is extremely rare that even the greatest artists dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
trust to the inspiration of the moment to provide them with adequate
accompaniment.</p>

<p>An artist may have a theme or motif borrowed from some composer,
and he may be sufficiently gifted to plan it out and develop it
for himself, but always with careful thought and deliberation before
he gives it public expression.</p>

<p>The dual art is as full of vagaries and traps as the French language,
and at first the student who finds himself handicapped by inability to
conquer it, cannot do better than study some poems written to music,
and at these he must work steadily before he attempts to patter to accompaniment.</p>

<p>A few musical poems mastered will go far to secure him an air of
ease and self-possession.</p>

<img src="images/illo091.png" alt="" width="300" height="425" />

<p class="caption">Correct attitude at piano.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>For instance, undertake some such study as Racine&#8217;s tragedy of
&#8220;Athalie,&#8221; which has been so exquisitely set to music by Mendelssohn.
In the opening bar of &#8220;Allegro Moderato,&#8221; a few notes are played
to introduce the passage, &#8220;Where do those women and their children
go?&#8221; Then there are a few more notes, followed by the words, &#8220;The
Lord hath laid the queen of cities low.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four succeeding bars are treated in the same way. The music
ceases while &#8220;Her priests are captives&#8221; is recited. Then a chord is
struck, and the voice goes on unaccompanied, &#8220;Her monarchs are
rejected.&#8221; Another chord, &#8220;Her godly rites forsaken, unprotected.&#8221;
The sixth bar opens with a chord, and is followed by the words,
&#8220;Down, temple! Cedars, down!&#8221; and terminates with four semi-quavers.</p>

<p>This is an intensely dramatic poem, written in rhymed Alexandrines,
and the student must take great care not to rend the words from the
accompaniment, or the accompaniment from the words. The short
phrases and detached chords must punctuate and emphasize the sentences,
and lend weight and finish to the whole. This is not a difficult
task when compared with such a study as &#8220;The Dream of Jubal,&#8221; in
which the music accompanies the words in strict time, the combination
of voice and pianoforte flowing smoothly, the components dependent
and yet never waiting for each other.</p>

<p>The only way to reach perfection is to study the poem and music
separately at first, until the student is fairly familiar with both. Then
continue them with the aid of a metronome until the technicalities of
the mechanism, which include correct emphasis, pauses, and rhythm, and
the proper flow of the phrases, are mastered.</p>

<p>When this has been frequently rehearsed, the student may try his
powers without the metronome, and gradually, but surely, he will master
the antagonistic forces arrayed against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span></p>

<p>The artist who possesses a natural gift of composition will find it
extremely useful, for there are many exquisite poems which, although
seeming to clamor for a musical accompaniment, have not yet
been touched; but this combination is fraught with perils, and those
who approach it must be for
ever wary of the grotesque and
unfit.</p>

<p>In burlesque, of course, the
artist has great license in the
matter of accompaniment. He
may exaggerate and slash his
pianoforte (taking care never to
drown his voice), and achieve
the absolutely absurd and ludicrous,
but, in the poems or patter
that need delicacy, lightness of
touch, melancholy cadences or
bubbling, merry notes, he cannot
be too careful in the theme
he chooses to aid and color his
portrayal. In such pieces, the
right attitude, the right gesture,
the right expression must be
studied and gripped, so as to add
their subtle beauty to the whole.
The accompanying sketch shows
the correct attitude at the piano,
or rather, the attitude generally adopted by the professional musical-sketch
artist. The body is turned &#8220;three-quarters&#8221; to the audience,
the head full-faced, the left foot working the pedals, while the right
usually follows the direction in which the performer is looking.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XI</b><br />
VAMPING SIMPLIFIED</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Accompanist in an Hour</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> &#8220;vamping,&#8221; or the improvising of a musical accompaniment,
is considered by many anything but a classical accomplishment, yet
those who can accompany in this way are a decided help to a general
or children&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>In either case among the guests will be found some who possess
the gift of song, either comic or sentimental, but who lack the power
or the ability to play their own accompaniments.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig11_1">

<img src="images/illo092.png" alt="" width="600" height="274" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;First chord.</p>

<p class="music">Play <a href="music/music092.mid">First chord</a></p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Moreover, it may happen that the services of a skilled pianist are
not available, and in these circumstances any one who can vamp will
be deemed a useful acquisition.</p>

<p>The object of this chapter is not to give either intricate or comprehensive
instruction, but rather to suggest, even to those who have had
no musical training, a few rules whereby they will be enabled to step
into the breach occasioned by the absence of an accomplished player.</p>

<p>An ordinary piano has fifty notes, comprising A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
in succeeding order.</p>

<p>The whole keyboard is divided into two portions&mdash;treble and bass,
the former starting from the fourth C up from the left; the notes below
the fourth or middle C comprise the bass. (See <a href="#Fig11_1">Fig. 1</a>. Arrow denotes
middle C.)</p>

<p>Each black note above a white is its sharp, and each below its flat.
For example, taking the treble note G, the black note above it is G
sharp, the one below it G flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span></p>

<p>Before starting to vamp to a song, the singer must hum over a
line or so of the song in order that the &#8220;vampist&#8221; may keep both the
time and tone in his mind for transference to the piano.</p>

<p>His ear will tell him when he has struck a few chords whether they
are in the key in which the song is written. If he finds that when a
few bars of the song completing a distinct or rhythmical period have
been hummed the note finished on is C, then he will know that the key
is C, and find his chords as suggested by the diagrams given.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vamping Chords and their Relative Changes</span></h3>

<p>There are three principal chords in a key which are sufficient to
cover the range of melody. Starting in C, the first chord for the right
hand from the little finger to the thumb is made up of the notes middle
C, bass G, and bass E. The left hand strikes the octave C immediately
below the right hand thumb on E. (<a href="#Fig11_1">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>

<p>The second chord starts from little finger of right hand on F, first
finger on C, and thumb on A in bass, the octave F, below the right hand
A, being struck in the bass. (<a href="#Fig11_2">Fig. 2</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig11_2">

<p class="music">Play <a href="music/music093a.mid">Second chord</a></p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The third chord starts with little finger of right hand on G, third
finger on F, and thumb on B in bass, the left hand striking the
octave G below the B on which thumb of right hand is placed.
(<a href="#Fig11_3">Fig. 3</a>.)</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span></p>

<p>To complete the melody it is necessary to go back to the chord
started with, taking it up an octave or eight notes higher in both
hands.</p>

<p>The relative changes are brought about by the use of the following
chords. Striking the F sharp with the little finger of right hand,
the first finger is placed on the D, and the thumb upon middle
C, the left hand taking the octave F sharp immediately below middle C.
(<a href="#Fig11_4">Fig. 4</a>.)</p>

finger strikes E, and the thumb D; the octave G sharp being struck
in the bass by the left hand. (<a href="#Fig11_6">Fig. 6</a>.)</p>

<p>The twin chord to the one just described is made by placing the
right hand little finger on A, the first finger on E, and the thumb on
middle C; the octave A, immediately below middle C, being struck by
the left hand. (<a href="#Fig11_7">Fig. 7</a>.)</p>

<p>The little finger of the right hand is placed on C sharp, first finger
on A, and the thumb on G, both the latter notes being bass&mdash;that is,
below middle C. The left hand strikes the octave C sharp in the bass.
(<a href="#Fig11_8">Fig. 8</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w550" id="Fig11_9">

<p class="music">Play <a href="music/music095c.mid">chord</a></p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The last chord is made by striking D above middle C with the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
finger of the right hand, A below middle C with the first finger, and
F also below middle C with the right hand thumb; the left hand takes
the octave D in the bass. (<a href="#Fig11_9">Fig. 9</a>.)</p>

<p>By a study of the chords set forth above it is seen that the octave
struck by the left hand in every case is a lower tone of the note played
by the little finger of the right hand&mdash;viz., if the little finger of the
right hand strikes G in the treble, the octave G is played by the left
hand in the bass.</p>

<p>An effective ending to a vamping accompaniment is brought about
by the use of a &#8220;run.&#8221; Starting from the C in the bass below the
middle C (indicated by arrow on diagram), and playing the E and G
with first and second fingers, the thumb is taken under, on to the
middle C and the action repeated twice, the run finishing on the fourth
C in the treble. (<a href="#Fig11_10">Fig. 10</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig11_10">

<p class="music">Play <a href="music/music096.mid">&#8220;run&#8221;</a></p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is useful and interesting to bear in mind that any chord can be
made by placing the little finger on a note desired, missing the next
two covered by the second and third fingers, striking the note covered
by first finger, missing the next, and striking the one covered by the
thumb.</p>

<p>Having committed the above chords and &#8220;run&#8221; to memory, the
performer can play them to suit the time in which the accompanied song
is written.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XII</b><br />
AN EVENING AT THE PHONOGRAPH</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Concert at Home</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> possess a gramophone or phonograph is to be already furnished
with the means of giving a very successful and pleasurable entertainment.
There are so many &#8220;entertainments&#8221; that do not entertain, and
so many &#8220;amusements&#8221; that do not amuse, that it is a distinct relief
to know where to turn when a mixed party of guests have honored
you with their presence.</p>

<p>With the number of gramophones, phonographs, talking-machines
and zonophones now on the market, it is not the object of this chapter
to specialize any particular make or type of article. As in most things,
quality means expense, and there is little use in hoping for fine results
from a cheap machine. Any respectable dealer will give useful advice
as to the type of gramophone worth buying, and it must be left with
you to make your own choice.</p>

<p>Presuming you have obtained your machine and accustomed yourself
to the manipulation of its various parts, the next point to be
considered is how a successful programme may be carried out for an
entertainment.</p>

<p>In nothing, perhaps, is that old adage that &#8220;tastes differ&#8221; so true
as in music. One person may shiver with disgust at everything but
Bach, whilst her neighbor probably can appreciate nothing but old
ballads; or whereas paterfamilias beats time ecstatically to the familiar
old pieces of Verdi and Rossini which he remembers from his boyhood,
his cultivated son is impatient for something out of &#8220;Elektra.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it is the business of the entertainer to satisfy and please all
these people&mdash;to send none away empty, but to make each person feel
what a pleasant evening he or she has had. Whilst fully recognizing
the difficulty of producing this result, it is hoped that the following
hints may serve to render the construction of a catholic programme a
little easier than would at first appear.</p>

<p>Records are of two kinds&mdash;instrumental and vocal. By blending
these successfully a very charming variety can be obtained which will
materially assist in keeping the programme from lapsing into sameness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span></p>

<p>Commence with a stirring overture or a rousing march that will
set the feet of your audience itching to mark time. Avoid anything
dreamy or languorous; let their attention be attracted by a bold stroke,
by the rattle of drums and the blaring of cornets and trombones.
Sousa&#8217;s marches, the &#8220;Stars and Stripes&#8221; for instance, are admirable
pieces to start the evening with, arousing the attention and stirring the
blood of every healthy person in the room.</p>

<p>Having now excited the interest of your audience, give them some
vocal music. Choose a good quartette of well-known singers in a
selection or song from some up-to-date opera, or even from one of the
old Italian favorites. &#8220;The Barber of Seville,&#8221; &#8220;La Boh&ecirc;me,&#8221; or &#8220;La
Tosca,&#8221; all provide very fine quartettes.</p>

<p>The next piece might be a good instrumental solo, on violin, &#8217;cello,
piccolo or clarionet. Let it be short and characteristic; preferably a
piece fairly well known to the majority of your audience.</p>

<p>At this point it may be remarked that people invariably like hearing
what they already know. The gramophone is more generally appreciated
when it reproduces a song or piece of music that the audience
has heard before; whilst the machine is scarcely suitable for the introduction
of wholly new music. Of course it is impossible to form an
entire programme on these lines, but when making the selection of
records, if you bear this fact in mind it will save you from obtaining
a number of outlandish pieces, if one may so style them, which the
majority of your company has never heard before and will be little
likely to wish to hear again.</p>

<p>After the instrumental solo, it will be suitable to have a vocal solo&mdash;say
a soprano. Again, select a good artist and a good song, for it
is at this point that your fiercest critics will be upon the lookout. Do
your best to disappoint them of their prey by having none but the best
singers; and only then at their very best!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Humorous Songs</span></h3>

<p>With a mixed company humorous songs are usually appreciated,
and one may be very well introduced at this point. The greatest care
must be exercised in avoiding anything that the most squeamish person
might think objectionable. The number of perfectly harmless and refined
comic songs is great, but unfortunately the number of vulgar songs
is greater. Accept nothing, therefore, that you have not heard yourself
and know to be perfectly suitable.</p>

<p>A good piano solo may now be very serviceable, or even a piano
and violin duet. A piece of Chopin or Schumann, a short piece of
Godard, or the like, is sure to be appreciated. The most carping of<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
critics will be unable to find fault with the execution of Paderewski,
Hoffman, or other great pianists, all of whose records are easily obtainable.</p>

<p>A popular item from one of the current operas or musical comedies
will then be acceptable. If the works of Sullivan are too antiquated,
records of the more recent pieces recently running at the theaters can
easily be had. &#8220;Our Miss Gibbs,&#8221; &#8220;The Dollar Princess,&#8221; or the
&#8220;Arcadians&#8221;&mdash;all will help to furnish you with some variety in the
programme. Choose a favorite that will bring up pleasant recollections
to all who have seen the original play.</p>

<p>A tenor and bass duet may follow the above admirably, something
rather pathetic&mdash;a love song or the like. The task of making a choice
amongst so many songs of this class would be invidious, and it is left
to the taste and opportunities of the entertainer to select what seems
best for the occasion.</p>

<p>It is now time for another piece of orchestral music, and a good
waltz is suggested&mdash;&#8220;The Merry Widow,&#8221; or something of that kind,
played by a good band, and of a rather catchy nature.</p>

<p>If you divide the entertainment into two parts, the familiar intermezzo
of the &#8220;Cavalleria Rusticana&#8221; makes a very suitable overture
for the second part. Obtain it on a good orchestra, and not as a piano
or violin solo. Failing this any of Puccini&#8217;s overtures are good for
such an occasion.</p>

<p>The second part of the programme should be constructed on very
much the same principles as the first. A few classical pieces can be
introduced&mdash;Wagner and Grieg, Schubert and Elgar, and similar
contrasts.</p>

<p>Tenor, bass, soprano and contralto solos should be fitted in between
the heavier items, whilst instrumental solos are generally highly appreciated
amongst really musical audiences. Do not let the selections be too
long, however.</p>

<p>Before closing the entertainment with &#8220;The Star Spangled Banner,&#8221;
have a good orchestral waltz to put every one in good humor.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Arrangements</span></h3>

<p>And now for a few hints as to the actual performance. Do not
be too ready to give encores. Many people really dislike to hear a
thing twice, and unless you see there is a very general desire amongst
your audience for a repetition, pass on to the next item immediately.</p>

<p>Have the seats comfortably arranged, and see that every one is
seated before beginning your programme. Copies of the programme
should be handed to each person present, and the name and number<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
announced before starting the machine. Be careful that no hitch occurs
in the arrangements.</p>

<p>Remember that the greatest of artists can be called to your assistance&mdash;Caruso,
Melba, Patti, Albani, Tamagno (who though dead yet
sings), Constantino, Tetrazzini, and numberless other great singers and
musicians are at your beck and call, ready to sing to your friends or
to exert their greatest talents on your behalf. Avail yourselves of them
unsparingly, and you cannot miss success.</p>

<p>A Sunday programme is no more difficult to arrange. Magnificent
records of the &#8220;Messiah,&#8221; &#8220;Elijah,&#8221; and many other great oratorios
can be obtained, whilst numberless hymns and anthems are possible
to the gramophone, sung by some of the finest choirs.</p>

<p>With these hints there should be no great difficulty in making a
programme that will prove enjoyable to a mixed audience. They are,
however, but hints; to give exact instructions would be impossible.
The selection, even upon the lines sketched out in this chapter, must
be individual and adapted to the more immediate requirements of your
company, and in consequence no fixed rule for choice can be given.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XIII</b><br />
MUSICAL GLASSES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Great Inventor&#8217;s Hopes</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A hundred and fifty</span> years ago the fashionable society of London
went mad over musical glasses. When the cloth had been removed
and the company were seated at the polished table, discussing the
dessert and enjoying the rare old port, it was considered a great
attainment, after having partially filled the finger-bowls, to be able
to extract music by casually rubbing a finger around their rims.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, even the great composer Gluck did
not consider this musical trick beneath his genius, and used to
pride himself upon the skill he had acquired in this kind of performance.</p>

<p>Mozart composed a song to be played in this manner, and many
famous musicians devoted their energies to perfecting a branch of the
science which they considered to be full of promise.</p>

<p>Even Benjamin Franklin turned his genius to the subject,
and after many experiments succeeded in inventing an apparatus
called a Harmonica, which he hoped would take its place amongst the
recognized musical instruments of his day. From various causes,
which shall be explained later, this invention was never attended with
the success its author anticipated.</p>

<p>Considerable knack is required to obtain a clear note from a glass.
A fine finger-bowl, preferably uncut, or a champagne glass, must
be partly filled with water, and the performer should then damp his
forefinger and also wet the rim of the glass. If the finger now be
passed lightly but firmly round a portion of the rim, after a few
touches a clear ringing sound will be produced. If at first this is
difficult to obtain, pass the finger several times in one direction&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
from right to left, and then reverse from left to right. Having done
this for a few seconds, the glass will, in all probability, begin to
sound.</p>

<p>As has been said, quite a knack is requisite to perform this with
any success, but the beginner should not be discouraged if failure
attends the first few attempts, as, after a little practice, which seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
to produce nothing but a sad groaning noise, the glass will suddenly
begin to ring. Having devoted a little patience to learning the exact
touch, the performer will find that the slightest movement of his finger
produces the desired note.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Little Water = Low Note</span></h3>

<p>The note given out depends entirely upon the amount of liquid in
the glass. The less water the lower will be the note; the more water
the higher it will be. Therefore taking eight glasses, or fine finger-bowls,
and filling each one to a different level with water, a complete
octave can be obtained.</p>

<p>The amount of water to be placed in each depends entirely upon
the size of the bowl and the texture of the glass, and must therefore
be determined by the performer himself. A keen ear will soon
enable him to get the glasses thoroughly in tune, and they can then
be arranged before him in the order of the notes in the scale.</p>

<p>For those who desire to attain proficiency in this art, it would be
well to color the water distinctively in each glass, in a manner
similar to the following:</p>

<table summary="Tuning">

<tr>
<td class="right">1.</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr3">C</td>
<td class="left">clear</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right">2.</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr3">D</td>

<td class="center padl1 padr3">E</td>
<td class="left">blue</td>

<tr>
<td class="right">4.</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr3">F</td>

<td class="right">5.</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr3">G</td>

<td class="left">black</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="3" class="center">(See <a href="#Fig13_1">Fig. 1</a>.)</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>By this arrangement the performer can tell at a glance which glass he
must touch to obtain the note required. This is more especially
applicable to beginners, for, after some practice, the relative positions
of the glasses become fixed in the mind, and he knows instinctively
where to turn for whichever note is wanted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Half-Notes</span></h3>

<p>Half-notes can be made by adjusting the amount of water, which
can be colored accordingly; but for an ordinary entertainment the
octave will be found quite sufficient, and at any rate to begin with,
will require all the musician&#8217;s attention. When he can play quickly
and correctly with his first eight glasses, he can introduce half-notes,
but it is very unwise to start with too many vessels, for it will give
both him and his audience far greater satisfaction to hear eight glasses
played well than to hear a larger number played indifferently.</p>

<p>An important point to remember is to keep the finger and the rim<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
thoroughly wet. If this be borne in mind, the notes will come much
more easily and clearly, whilst the disagreeable droning sound will
entirely disappear. Care must also be taken to see that the glasses are
steady on their bases, as, in the case of champagne glasses, especially,
they are liable to tip up under the pressure of the finger.</p>

<p>With regard to the music suitable to musical glasses, it has already
been mentioned that Gluck and Mozart composed songs for this class
of performance, but the beginner is not recommended to attempt
these until he is very skillful. As some time will elapse before
he can play even the scale with ease, perfectly simple music should
be all that he tries to learn at first. When such easy, although
somewhat hackneyed, pieces as &#8220;The Blue Bells of Scotland&#8221; and
&#8220;Annie Laurie&#8221; have been mastered, he can try more advanced
works.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Showing finger-bowls containing various colored waters at different levels,
each level indicating a different note.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Many attempts have been made to discover some means of
producing the sound other than by rubbing the finger over the rim
of the glass. Violin bows and other similar contrivances have all
proved ineffectual.</p>

<p>It would seem that the texture and surface of the human skin are
alone suitable for this purpose, and nothing else has proved successful.
This is the reason why musical glasses have not become more
common, for the continual rubbing of the wet finger over the surface
of the glass becomes after a time somewhat unpleasant. However,
this hardly applies to the short period that an ordinary
performer would devote to an entertainment. Yet such was the
reason that caused the failure of Franklin&#8217;s instrument.</p>

<p>The following few bars of music, being the opening phrases of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
well-known song, will prove very suitable for glass music, especially
when played at the dinner-table after the dessert has been discussed.
To simplify the matter for those who are not familiar with the usual
notation of music, the notes are given by name, thus enabling any one
to pick them out with ease:</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XIV</b><br />
HAND-BELL RINGING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Sweet-lipped Friend</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something vital in the ordinary bell that dominates all of us.
It is an important factor in our lives. The railway bell&#8217;s clamor
reminds us that haste is needed to catch the departing train. The
dinner bell tells that the meal is ready for our consumption. The
church bell, the wedding chime, the fire bell, the tolling funeral bell,
are all our faithful monitors and guardians, but the exquisite voice of
the hand-bell is the sweet-lipped friend that wooes us in our hour
of ease.</p>

<p>Hand-bell ringing is full of charm and interest, and it is astonishing
of what changing harmonies these instruments are capable when
manipulated by dexterous hands. Undertaken with perseverance and
patience to overcome its rudimentary difficulties, this form of campanology
may be achieved with great success.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to go to a well-known firm to secure the
necessary bells, which must be perfectly in tune. The beginner needs
only a few, as for some time he must essay only the simplest tunes.
The best hand-bells are somewhat expensive, but to buy cheap inferior
instruments is false economy and most unsatisfactory, for sonorousness
and sweetness of tone depend upon purity of metal and perfect
balance.</p>

<p>Those known as the &#8220;four-in-hand&#8221; consist of four hand-bells
attached by means of a leather handle to one base. This enables the
player to manipulate eight bells at once. Of course, by making careful
inquiries, or by advertising, good second-hand sets of bells can be bought
quite cheaply.</p>

<p>It is advisable that the bells be tuned to old Philharmonic pitch,
C&mdash;540, and they should be fitted with improved pegged clappers.</p>

<p>The first step undertaken by the novice at bell-ringing is to consider
and study the construction of the bell. It is surmounted by a loop of
leather, and the hinge of the clapper is so made that it can sound
only when swayed towards the flat part of the handle. The part of
the clapper that touches the bell is composed of felt and not of metal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
but this alone is too light a material for the springs, which, it has been
discovered, resist it.</p>

<p>To overcome this difficulty it is necessary that the felt should be
weighted. This achievement needs skill and experience, for the springs
and weight naturally vary according to the size of the bell, and are in
exact proportion, small springs being necessary for the small bells and
large springs for the large ones.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bell-ringing Companies</span></h3>

<p>Bell-ringing companies consist of five players, and these are generally
composed of two ladies and three gentlemen; all should be
physically strong and possessed of the sense of strict notation and
music-reading ability. The ladies generally undertake the alto and
tenor parts. The strongest player manages the bass bells, and the
most reliable and cool-headed of the party the treble, which is divided
into first and second, and is extremely important, needing no small
amount of agility and nerve, especially in difficult and intricate
passages.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why five players are advisable. Four
could not manage the full harmonies of treble, alto, tenor, and bass,
while more than five are apt to get in each other&#8217;s way, besides taking
up too much space on a small platform in a drawing-room.</p>

<p>A long table, covered with some heavy material, such as thick
baize or half-a-dozen pairs of good blankets, is essential. Blankets are
the best. They should not be spread out or divided, but folded upon
the surface, and then concealed by a cloth. This keeps the sound from
vibrating through the wood of the table, as the bells are placed upon
it, at the termination of each note.</p>

<p>The bells must be in easy reach of the ringer, and the company
just formed will do well to chalk lines upon the cloth to divide their
positions from that occupied by the neighbor&#8217;s bells.</p>

<p>Tenor and alto players should occupy the center of the table.
Their work, compared with that of bass and treble, is light and subordinate,
and this is why those parts may be undertaken by ladies.
The second treble stands at the right end, next to the alto, and the first
treble and bass occupy the head and bottom of the table, as shown in
<a href="#Fig14_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>Immediately after the bell is used the player must be careful to
replace it in its former position in the chalked space, or confusion and
discord will be the result, as it is almost impossible to remember the<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
position of the bells unless this plan is strictly adhered to. To pick
up the wrong bell will lead to disaster.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Many plans have been tried in which to place the bells so that
each player may identify the different bells to be used. Perhaps the
simplest and most usually adopted is to arrange them in rows upon the
table. Supposing the number of bells required to be fifteen, place
them in three lines of five. For the first row employ the letters of the
alphabet; for the second, even rows of figures; for the last, single
odd figures, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore15">This plan should be learnt, and the position of the bells be as fixed
and relative to each other as the notes of the keyboard of the pianoforte.
At first the players stand with the left side turned slightly to the table,
but frequently they will be obliged to change their positions, sometimes
turning to the right and sometimes facing the table. The bell should
never be placed with the flat side of its handle towards the manipulator,
for in this position it cannot be struck, however much waved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span></p>

<p>In holding the bell, the thumb must be pressed on the rivet, the
fingers gripping the flat side of the handle. When lifting the bell,
the handle should slope towards the body, thus forcing the weight
of the clapper to swing to the side opposite to that upon which the
strike sounds. The bell, being lifted in this position, is not struck, the
hand changing its inclination from left to right. In so doing, the bell
is turned to an opposite angle, the clapper falls, and the strike is
achieved by a slight impetus of the arm or wrist.</p>

<p>The student should practice lifting and striking the bell with
alternate hands, until it is as easy to manage it with the left hand as
the right. When he has mastered this difficulty he may try the
working of two bells&mdash;one in each hand, lifting one bell while the
other is struck, taking care, however, always to place them in such a
position that no turning or twisting of the handle is necessary before
action, as this involves loss of time, and makes him liable to constant
blunders when he takes part in a tune.</p>

<p>The length of the table varies according to the number of bells
required and the style of music undertaken. Forty-four bells are
sufficient for most simple melodies and exercises, and for them the
space required is about 11 feet by 5 feet.</p>

<h3>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Flourishing</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>&#8220;Flourishing&#8221; the bells is impossible in quick music, and is only
undertaken in slow passages, when the notes are to be sustained. In
working the bells alternately, the dying vibration of one bell must never
be allowed to mingle with the next, for this is even more discordant
than when, in pianoforte playing, a pedal is kept down too long, and
makes the vibration of one chord jar into the next.</p>

<p>To prevent this, the vibrating bell should be placed on the table
immediately before the other is about to be struck, but not in such a
manner as to rob the note of its proper value. In a staccato passage,
on the contrary, the bells should be set quickly on the table as soon as
they have sounded.</p>

<p>In practicing the ringing of alternate bells, make each vibration the
value of a semibreve, then a minim, and lastly a crotchet, until perfect
dexterity is achieved, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig14_3">

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>When the trebles are divided, the first treble plays the notes turned
upwards, and the second treble the downward tailed&mdash;thus, in the scale
of <span class="nowrap">C:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="music">Play <a href="music/music109.mid">music</a></p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The notes should follow without any break as continuously and
smoothly as though one player were ringing the scale.</p>

<p>Ringing two bells in each hand is difficult of accomplishment. In
order to do this successfully, one bell is lifted and gripped in the right
hand by the first and second fingers and struck downward. Then
another bell is inserted between the thumb and first finger, the flat part
of the handles at right angles. The first bell is again struck down,
when it will be discovered that the second bell remains silent until it is
slightly turned from left to right by a quick wrist movement, while in
its turn the first bell gives no sound, simply because it needs a downward
stroke, and the side stroke, which gives voice to the second bell,
is in a contrary direction.</p>

<p>Extreme care and perseverance are necessary before these two bells
can be properly manipulated, and a great number of exercises which
the student can construct for himself should be practiced.</p>

<p>Chromatic notes present great difficulty, especially in more advanced
music, and can only be mastered gradually. In simpler passages,
when they occur, the student should place the chromatic bells in the
back row in the order in which they are to be used. If his chromatics
are arranged (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and he has memorized their
position beforehand, he will have no difficulty in finding them as they
are required.</p>

<p>A company of bell-ringers should have a large <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i> of music
of as much variety as possible. Many of the pieces which are most
suitable are somewhat hackneyed, and yet are cordially welcomed
when musically treated, and other works can always be arranged for
playing.</p>

<p>Tone, expression, and phrasing are all-important. The rhythm of
sounds must not alter with the changing of the bells. It must continue
in a sweet flow of music, just as if one hand were manipulating
every bell. The jerk, the overlong pause, or the lack of tone in one
player&#8217;s work, has power to mar the whole performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span></p>

<p>In large orchestras constant playing together is necessary for proper
union and harmonizing of sounds, and this is equally essential in bell-ringing.
It must ever be remembered that &#8220;practice makes perfect,&#8221;
and the blending of the bells needs unending patience and persistence.</p>

<p>For beginners such pieces as &#8220;The Minstrel Boy,&#8221; &#8220;She Wore a
Wreath of Roses,&#8221; &#8220;Home, Sweet Home,&#8221; &#8220;The Last Rose of Summer,&#8221;
and the National Anthem prove stepping-stones to enterprises
of a more complicated nature, and should be carefully studied, for
&#8220;vaulting ambition&#8221; is quite out of the question in the art of hand-bell
ringing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most delightful sounds in the drawing-room is the music of
the human voice, uplifted in song to a soft pianoforte accompaniment,
if, of course, the voice be tuneful, easily produced, and sympathetic,
and the breathing taken without effort.</p>

<p>The first steps to be considered in singing are (1) correct breathing,
(2) voice production, (3) clear pronunciation. The tongue should
be hollowed behind the teeth, not rolled up in a
ball, thus closing the vocalist&#8217;s throat. The uvula,
so called because of its supposed likeness to a
grape, should be lifted to the roof of the soft
palate, the mouth presenting a hollow open chamber,
through which the notes issue in clear, bell-like tones
(<a href="#Fig15_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The beginner will find this a difficult matter, and
effort and will are needed to keep the tongue down
and the uvula up. The position of the former may
be demonstrated by means of the handle of a teaspoon
pressed against it. The tongue will prove rebellious until
practice makes it perfectly easy and natural to subdue it in the necessary
manner.</p>

<p>In breathing, inhale a long slow breath through the nose only,
keeping the mouth closed. The air should originate in the upper part
of the diaphragm, and be held until the ribs are slowly inflated,
balloon fashion, when it should be exhaled through the open mouth,
gently and without effort until the ribs contract. Never push the ribs
to lengthen the expiration of breath.</p>

<p>A good plan to insure easy and quiet breathing is to count slowly
to ten while the chest box is being inflated, and also when the
air is being exhaled. In this manner the breath will be prevented
from coming and going in spasmodic gasps and jerks. The number
ten may be increased gradually to twenty or thirty, until the student is
able to produce breath sufficient for the phrase vocalized. Regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
breathing exercises should be taken every day before singing, the hands
being placed upon the ribs, in order to feel and insure their gradual
rise and fall.</p>

<p>An anatomical study of the throat, windpipe, and lungs should be
made (<a href="#Fig15_2">Fig. 2</a>), and this will considerably help the student to understand
the difficult mechanism of voice
production.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig15_2">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Throat, windpipe,
and lungs.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Practice gradually adds new notes to
the voice, but the young singer must be
careful not to strain the vocal organs by
endeavoring to sing high and low notes
before they are naturally developed.</p>

<p>Concones and every variety of singing
exercises should be practiced before a song
is undertaken. Over-practice is harmful.
Vocal organs should never be fatigued or
unduly taxed, and half-an-hour&#8217;s practice
is ample&mdash;indeed, more valuable than an hour at a stretch.</p>

<p>Singing directly after meals should be avoided, and the throat must
not be coddled in furs or compressed by high collars.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dainty Modern Songs</span></h3>

<p>In drawing-room singing, four or five-versed lyrics are not nearly
so charming as the dainty modern songs of two or three verses, and
these must never be undertaken until the student has reached a proper
understanding of phrasing, breathing, and expression.</p>

<p>Many singers prefer to accompany themselves, but this has its
disadvantages, as the voice is far better produced when the vocalist
is standing. The position should be easy and natural, the head erect,
but not lifted back, as this contracts and narrows the larynx.</p>

<p>While the singer should enter into the idea of the composer, she
should have her own conception of the song, and endeavor to give it,
as far as possible, her own individual expression, her voice being
colored by the cultivation of her soul; otherwise the most perfect
vocalization will fail to move the audience.</p>

<p>These elementary rules hold good for the male as well as the
female singer, and cannot be too carefully considered.</p>

<p>A further important factor in the art of singing is the hygiene of
the human body. The singer must cherish physical health. Plenty
of outdoor exercise should be taken. Indulgence in drinking and
over-eating is injurious. To practice when fatigued, or indisposed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
is to risk permanent harm to the voice; and to sing when suffering
from a cold is extremely foolish. At such times, breathing exercises
may be taken with advantage, as they clear the lungs and help towards
recovery.</p>

<p>Lady singers are sometimes inclined to wear gowns which do not
allow them sufficient room for breathing purposes, and they will
often willfully sacrifice the well-being of their voices to be fashionably
attired. In order to perform their functions properly, the lungs
and ribs must have space and freedom from pressure. Too narrow
bodices are almost as pernicious to the voice as tight lacing, for these
seriously retard the breathing, and what in loose garments is natural
and easy of accomplishment, becomes an obvious struggle, which
fatigues the singer and renders her voice thin and poor in quality.
This is often the reason why a vocalist is seen to lift her shoulders
and pant audibly during her song, thus marring her conception, which
may be, in every other particular, delightful and artistic.</p>

<p>Many singers with weak lungs find voice production extremely
beneficial, for proper breathing and careful practice do more to strengthen
a delicate chest than any bottled remedies.</p>

<p>The vocalist should never stoop (for this narrows and compresses
the vocal organs), and in singing the first care should be to see that
the shoulders are well thrown back, although not strained to an unnatural
position.</p>

<p>In practicing, it is beneficial to keep the arms folded behind the
back, placing the hands over the elbows, and taking care not to
thrust the head forward. This will keep the chest expanded, and
the body easily upright.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Value of a Good Accompanist</span></h3>

<p>When performing, it is necessary to be equipped with a good
accompanist&mdash;one who understands the art thoroughly, and refrains
from banging out the notes as if the voice of the singer were merely
the background to his own performance. The three qualities essential
in an accompanist are sympathy, artistic sensibility, and discernment
to understand the temperament and conception of the vocalist.</p>

<p>An inefficient accompanist has power to transform an artist&#8217;s
highest and most conscientious endeavor into irritability and inability
to render individual expression. Pianists frequently are highly recommended
to singers because of their gift of sight reading. Now
this is a very valuable and important accessory, but there are many
excellent sight readers who have no idea of that delicate and tactful
manipulation of accompaniment found in the true artist, and who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
even though they play correctly the most difficult music placed before
them, sadly fail because of inadequate comprehension of the needs
vital to the singer.</p>

<p>To hustle the singer is almost as heinous a fault as to lag behind.
Some accompanists convey the fatiguing impression of a brake applied
to a carriage wheel, and the artist feels as if she were pulling the pianist
through the song, while others play as if they were racing to catch a
train, and there is not a moment to lose. Both these defects are
equally fatal. The pianist on these occasions should neither be independent
nor dependent. She or he must realize that, although the
pianoforte is subordinate, it is extremely important because of its
power to influence the mind and conception of the singer, who should
feel an electric tide of sympathy and support flowing from the pianoforte
and carrying the voice on a wave of sound.</p>

<p>An accompanist should be chosen with care, rehearsed with frequently,
and must possess individual qualities in common with the
temperament of the singer. A sense of reliability and strength conveyed
will do much to put the most nervous vocalist at ease, and give that
tranquility and self-possession without which no singing is successful.</p>

<p>Rehearsing before a mirror is of great assistance, for it is only in
studying the reflection of one&#8217;s features when singing that one is able
to check nervous mannerisms and facial contortions. Pains must be
taken to open the lips adequately wide, for the mouth is the mold;
the voice, the molten gold; and, if the mold is twisted or narrowed,
the gold will be warped and flawed in quality.</p>

<p>The simpler the manner of the singer the sweeter the song, for
the affectation sometimes indulged in, the airs and grimaces commonly
known as &#8220;side,&#8221; which some singers see fit to employ, are as unsightly
as a mud-splashed window-pane. They are often also the insignia of
the incompetent and the ignorant, for it is never the true artist who
thus obtrudes herself on her hearers.</p>

<p>Of course, in some cases apparent affectation really originates in
extreme nervousness and hyper self-consciousness. In such cases the
singer must battle patiently with this embarrassing trait until it is overcome,
for unless this is accomplished one&#8217;s singing can never be a
joy and delight.</p>

<p>In order to be successful, a song must be delivered harmoniously;
to voice sweet exquisite words accompanied by facial contortions is
to make a pitiful caricature of your performance.</p>

<p>Take care, therefore, that your attitude, features, and expression
combine to carry the emotion conveyed in your voice. Study unity and
repose. Endeavor to forget your own identity for the time being,
considering yourself only as the cage that holds the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span></p>

<p>Although the singer should be perfect mistress of the songs
forming her repertoire, she should always deliver them freshly and
spontaneously.</p>

<p>There is an old saying, &#8220;Familiarity breeds contempt,&#8221; and, notwithstanding
the fact that this is usually said of individuals, it may
be applied very truly to the relationship that exists between singer and
song.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Why Singers Often Fail</span></h3>

<p>It is very usual for an ambitious student to be consumed with
conscientious determination. She makes up her mind to learn a
difficult song, and she works assiduously at it day after day, week
after week, until she knows every word and every note.</p>

<p>By-and-by she performs it proudly to a select circle of friends,
and she is surprised and discouraged to find that all her keen
enthusiasm for the song has gone. It does not seem to suit her
voice; the words have lost meaning. The emotion she at first poured
into it has disappeared, and she is thoroughly disheartened, and is
quite unable to find reason or remedy for her indifference.</p>

<p>An experienced artist would be able to show that student in a
moment wherein her failure lay.</p>

<p>She had allowed herself to become too familiar, and familiarity
had bred contempt. The song doubtless needed practice, but not
incessant grinding and toiling. One cannot hammer the arts into
one&#8217;s head as if they were nails being driven into wood. The subtle
essence, the ephemeral spirit of the song will still evade the singer.
To catch that, and to reveal it to others, the work must be as pure as
the widespread petals of a flower.</p>

<p>So, when listlessness replaces your high enthusiasm for a song with
which you have become too familiar, do not be disheartened, but put
it away, and determine not to touch it or hear it sung until your first
eagerness to master it is reborn. Then, and then only, take it out
and sing it, and you will be astonished at the result; for having
mastered the technicalities you are able to pour your heart into
your words, and the result amazes you and delights your hearers,
who think you have never sung anything better or more suitable to
the pitch and timbre of your voice.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XVI</b><br />
DRAWING-ROOM RECITALS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Keynote of Success</span></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1<i>a</i>.&mdash;The stiff,
unnatural position.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is frequently and quite erroneously supposed by the uninitiated
that, given a good memory and a pleasing voice, the young would-be
elocutionist may become highly successful in the art of reciting. It is
only the painstaking, experienced
artist who realizes that these attributes
are but as the husk to the
nut, the calyx to the bud.</p>

<p>Cased in its shell is the kernel,
and folded in its green sheath are
the petals of the flower. So, likewise,
the voice and power of
memorizing must be but the covering
of numerous other qualities,
attained only by perseverance,
judicious practice, and that artistic
sense of fitness without which all
attempts to excel are in vain.</p>

<p>It is impossible to play a symphony
on the pianoforte before
grinding away at the rudiments of
music, and no one may build a
house without mastering the elements
of architecture. Yet the
difficult art of reciting is often
approached by a novice, who,
having pounded some poem or
prose into his or her memory
(reciting is usually a feminine
qualification) plunges into it with
all the self-satisfaction of ignorance, and pains or fatigues her listeners
by her flagrant and unsympathetic rendering of a masterpiece, which,
in experienced hands, would be an exquisite piece of work, something
to be remembered and dwelt upon with considerable pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span></p>

<p>The speaking voice, properly treated, is an instrument of exquisite
music, capable of as many shades of feeling and power as the pipe
organ. Before all else the voice must possess sympathy, sweetness,
power of expression, and naturalness; and, unless these qualities are
governed by a high sensibility, keen intuition, and common sense,
they are futile.</p>

<p>The wing of the voice is the breath. Unless this is elastic, easily
and naturally produced, the voice is like a crippled bird, or similar to
a musical instrument with broken strings. Thus the cultivation of
voice and breath is the most powerful adjunct to good reciting, and
this only comes by constant practice.</p>

<p>In practicing, the reciter should stand in an easy attitude (<a href="#Fig16_1">Fig. 1</a>)&mdash;erect,
but not stiffly upright, and with muscles neither tense nor
unduly lax, as in <a href="#Fig16_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a>. &#8220;There are no straight lines in Nature.&#8221;
This is an invaluable motto for the student. The best method of
gaining a clear and flexible voice is to read aloud some paragraph
or verse softly at first, studying the meaning and sound of every
word spoken, and endeavoring to express its phonetic quality, not
only with the lip, but with the eyes. A mirror is an excellent help
(<a href="#Fig16_2">Fig. 2</a>). It will show the beginner the difference between facial expression
and facial contortion (<a href="#Fig16_2A">Fig. 2<i>a</i></a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Speaking Register</span></h3>

<p>The paragraph may be repeated in a gradual crescendo until the
full power of the voice is used, always taking care to avoid harsh
and stridulous tones, and not strain or fatigue the throat. When the
student has accomplished this to her satisfaction, she should allow
her voice to die gradually away, until it is almost a whisper, but
her tone must always be clear and round in quality. This method<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
will bring many different shades of inflection and feeling into the
voice, and she will be astonished at the notes she will add to her
speaking register.</p>

<p>A good exercise is to make out a list of abstract words, and, concentrating
attention upon them, endeavor to convey their full meaning
with the aid of the mirror. Such sentences as: &#8220;I <i>love</i> you <i>dearly</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;My <i>hate</i> is too deep for <i>words</i>,&#8221; &#8220;My <i>scorn</i> is <i>intense</i>,&#8221; &#8220;My <i>tender
concern</i>,&#8221; &#8220;My <i>pity</i>,&#8221; &#8220;My <i>contempt</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;My <i>indifference</i>,&#8221; &#8220;My <i>desire</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;My <i>despair</i>,&#8221; and other impromptu phrases may be spoken in different
tones, united, with eye and features, to express the qualities voiced.</p>

<p>The student need not despair because she has a bad or untrained
memory. The power of memorizing verse or prose only requires
diligence and concentration to become facile and natural. Exaggeration,
affectation, melodrama, and meaningless gesture should be
avoided, for there is nothing so appealing as simplicity.</p>

<p>Before reading a poem aloud, the reciter should master the meaning
of the story it sets forward. She must remember that she is about
to paint a picture in words. To do this effectively, she must avoid
daubing in lurid colors. She will find it helpful to regard her
mind as her palette, her voice as her brush, and her color tones as
sympathy, tranquillity, gentleness, optimism, faithfulness, and clearness
of expression. She should take as much pains when practicing as
when performing before others, endeavoring to criticise her mode of
speech and expression just as though she were listening to some one
else&#8217;s recital.</p>

<p>The following simple rules will prove of great <span class="nowrap">assistance:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="rules">

<li>&#8199;1.  Breathe easily, inflating the lungs slowly, and without effort
or sound.</li>

<li>&#8199;2.  Speak distinctly and clearly, and avoid shouting.</li>

<li>&#8199;3.  Sound the consonants, but do not hiss them.</li>

<li>&#8199;4.  Sound the syllables distinctly, but without undue emphasis.</li>

<li>&#8199;5.  Sound the definite article without giving it too much importance.</li>

<li>&#8199;6.  Read brightly and naturally.</li>

<li>&#8199;7.  Avoid monotony: graduate tones by feeling.</li>

<li>&#8199;8.  Understand clearly and sympathetically what is studied.</li>

<li>&#8199;9.  Read with earnestness, but without heaviness.</li>

<li>10. Mind pauses and emphasis.</li>

</ul>

<p>Here is an example from &#8220;David Copperfield&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With
a window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and <i>is</i> seen
many times during the morning&#8217;s service by Peggotty, who likes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
make herself as sure as she can that it&#8217;s not being robbed, or is not in
flames. But, though Peggotty&#8217;s eye wanders, she is much offended if
mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to
look at the clergyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this passage the reciter is for the time being a little boy endeavoring
to sit quietly in church and fix his eyes on the clergyman. She
must be simplicity itself in order to depict the David and his surroundings,
lending a sympathetic eye that probes the brain and heart of the
child squeezed between his mother and nurse, and she must see every
detail as he describes it.</p>

<p>In order to do this successfully, intuition is essential. It will
inspire the voice to a like comprehension, with the result that her
listeners will be able to see that little weary figure quite plainly. Thus,
in everything undertaken, the student must learn to merge her personality
into that of the man, woman, or child of whom she is speaking,
so that the words spoken seem indeed to fall from the lips of the
characters portrayed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Appropriate Gesture</span></h3>

<p>Appropriate gesture presents difficulties, and, although occasionally
a powerful aid, it is more often a stumbling-block to the inexperienced
reciter. Many otherwise excellent recitals have been
marred by superfluous demonstrations, which remind one forcibly of
the action songs and recitations performed in a kindergarten, whilst
not a few reciters hedge themselves in with boundaries. They will
mention the sea, and point to a horizon, indicate distant hills, wood
and lake, frequently forgetting their respective situations. I have seen
upon more than one occasion a reciter engaged in a ludicrous juggling
of her scenery, pushing the sea aside to make room for the hills, and
merging her forests in the lake. This forgetfulness, usually engendered
by extreme nervousness, renders an artist ridiculous. How much
better, then, to refrain from gesticulation, unless she has mastered its
intricacies.</p>

<p>In drawing-room reciting the voice must expand according to the
acoustic properties of the apartment. A good way of making the
voice carry is to imagine it an india-rubber ball, which is being thrown
against the opposite wall. This thought will gradually insure its elastic
properties.</p>

<p>When reciting, the eyes should be kept from roving among the
audience, nor should they be fixed in a strained, glassy stare on the
ceiling, for they are too useful to the performer, and will be needed
to express different shades of thought.</p>

<p>If the reciter is nervous, she should endeavor not to show it<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
by twisting her fingers or moving her feet. The best cure for this
harassing affliction is to glance quietly at the audience <i>before</i> beginning
to recite. Taken individually, they will be found far from alarming.
After this, a determined endeavor should be made to concentrate the
mind on the artistic rendering of the recital.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig16_3">

<img src="images/illo120.png" alt="" width="400" height="377" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The epic radius, or mental zone.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>To many elocutionists, costumes are a help, enabling them to grip
more powerfully the character portrayed. In this case a certain
amount of gesture is advisable, but there are no hard and fast rules.
Actions must be governed by discretion and common sense.</p>

<p>The hand may properly be called a second tongue. As such it
should be treated, and, to continue the simile, should not be allowed
to stammer behind or chatter meaninglessly before the reciter.</p>

<p>The hands and arms are capable of a vast amount of expression
when properly used.</p>

<p>Gesture may be divided into three <span class="nowrap">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The epic radius, or mental zone, is the movement above the
head and horizontal with the shoulder (<a href="#Fig16_3">Fig. 3</a>). These are sweeping
and graceful, <i>not</i> jerky movements, indicating such sentiments as
honor, conscience, awe, veneration, &amp;c., and may be used with
advantage in such lines <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Speak the speech, I pray you,

it, as many of your players do, I
had as lief the town-crier spoke
my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand&mdash;thus;
but use all gently; for in the very
torrent, tempest, and (as I may
say) the whirlwind of passion, you

<h2><b>CHAPTER XVII</b><br />
THE ART OF WHISTLING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Methods of a Famous Siffleur</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no form of drawing-room entertainment which, when well
done, is more interesting than whistling, with pianoforte accompaniment.</p>

<p>Below are embodied the views and methods of Mr. Charles Capper,
the famous English siffleur, regarding this unique and attractive means
of entertainment.</p>

<p>The great part of humanity knows nothing of that ability of piping
and whistling so natural and melodious in the blackbird and thrush.
Most of us have at some time or other put by a little of our bread-and-butter
earnings in order to take a few lessons in learning to sing or
to play the pianoforte or some stringed instrument. But there are
comparatively few who turn to whistling as a means of livelihood or
as an accomplishment. It is fortunate that this is the case, for, unless
one possesses considerable natural talent, it is mere waste of money,
time, and endeavor.</p>

<p>Whistling cannot be hammered into being. It is only where real
ability is possessed that the student may set himself to work and overcome
its many difficulties, and hope to achieve his best.</p>

<p>Another gift equally essential is that of a good natural ear&mdash;an ear
that instantly distinguishes and corrects the note which is a shade flatter
or sharper than it should be.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of note that, while an unusually high roof to the
mouth is a disadvantage to the singer, it is&mdash;so some medical specialists
assert&mdash;a great gain to the whistler, and perhaps this is the reason why
it is so rare to meet skilled exponents of the art.</p>

<p>However, it is common enough to hear in almost every grade of
life the whistling that has never been cultivated. For example, in the
early morning, a few shrill tuneless notes float up to one&#8217;s bedchamber
from the area steps, as a dairyman hands in the allowance of milk;
but this annoys rather than delights, although it speaks eloquently of
the human soul of the whistler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<p>When the boy whistles, his mother knows he is well&mdash;in a good
temper, and contented with the whole universe. The merchant, stepping
into his office, may trill a few bars of &#8220;Tommy, make room
for your uncle,&#8221; and the sound conveys volumes to the sharp-eared
clerks, who foresee a day of unusual calm and peace; because a man
suffering from spleen, liver, gout, or toothache never so far forgets his
agony as to whistle.</p>

<p>Whistling invariably shows a light heart, and perhaps the reason
why the birds indulge in this pastime so freely is because they know
nothing of the burdens that beset mankind.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breathing and Tone</span></h3>

<p>The most important qualities to be observed in whistling are
production and control of breathing, modulation, purity and roundness
of tone.</p>

<p>The method of breathing in whistling is exactly similar to that
used in vocalization, and can be taught by any good teacher of singing.
Scales and exercises should be daily practiced with infinite care,&mdash;to
keep the notes clear and of even pitch.</p>

<p>Slurring or stumbling in a quick passage can be easily perceived&mdash;perhaps
more so in the whistler than in the singer. Scales and runs
should be undertaken, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed and
tone until perfect flexibility is attained.</p>

<p>Many a whistler capable of faultless execution fails to charm,
through monotony of tone. This is a fault as common as it is serious.
Whistling, with practice and thought, can be modulated in a far
greater degree than either the flute or the piccolo, and with much
greater effect.</p>

<p>It is not enough to whistle a song correctly. The student should
first study and memorize the words, so that he may express the tender
pathos expressed in the song.</p>

<p>The whistler should pay as much attention to artistic rendition as
the vocalist&mdash;if possible, even more&mdash;because he cannot voice the words
with which to appeal to the hearts of his hearers. He is obliged to
convey the sorrow, or humor, as the case may be, without the utterances
we recognize as the insignia of distress, joy, or love; and his heart
must be behind his notes, and enter into them, to win the spirits of the
audience to comprehension and sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Suitable Solos</span></h3>

<p>Whistling may be divided into two <span class="nowrap">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>The florid.</i>&mdash;necessary in such solos as Arditi&#8217;s &#8220;Il Bacio,&#8221;
which seems at first to the beginner to teem with insurmountable difficulties,
but which a little earnest practice will soon overcome.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The sentimental.</i>&mdash;In this category are Bishop&#8217;s early English
songs, such as &#8220;Bid me discourse,&#8221; &#8220;Tell me, my heart,&#8221; &#8220;Should he
upbraid,&#8221; &#8220;Lo, hear the gentle lark,&#8221; &#8220;Love has eyes,&#8221; Clay&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ll sing
thee songs of Araby,&#8221; &amp;c. All these songs make excellent whistling
solos, and are delightful when rendered with artistic sympathy and
meaning.</p>

<p>All songs must be memorized. The whistler cannot give necessary
control to his breathing and production if he holds the music in his
hand. In practicing, it should be placed on a music-stand, and, in
performing, must be note perfect. His whistling must be so faultless
in its conception that the audience must almost hear the words coming
from his lips.</p>

<p>Most of the solos forming the whistler&#8217;s repertoire are well known
and popular, and the verses of such songs as &#8220;My mother bids me
bind my hair&#8221; are familiar wherever the English language is spoken,
so that all audiences are capable of interpreting the meaning of the
sweet lilting notes. When we listen to &#8220;The Lost Chord,&#8221; played on
the organ, we seem to hear the throbbing rhythm of the words just
as if some spirit were singing them, and so it should be in the whistling
of Spohr&#8217;s &#8220;Rose softly blooming,&#8221; and many another song which will
doubtless occur to the student.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to whistle in too high a key, as this spoils
the quality of the tone, rendering it thin and shrill. The middle register
contains better notes than the higher.</p>

<p>The piccolo is pitched one octave higher than the flute, whilst the
whistler&#8217;s notes are said to be two octaves above the flute. Although
the notes whistled are apparently very high, when judged by the ear,
or compared with the pianoforte accompaniment, they are not so,
in reality.</p>

<p>It is rare to find the extremely high or the extremely low whistler.
Except in a very few cases, all whistle in about the same pitch. The
most usual key is F or G.</p>

<p>In spite of the old dogmatic assertion about the &#8220;whistling woman
and the crowing hen,&#8221; there are more young lady performers in this
profession than young men, and very charming whistlers some of
them are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span></p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that not infrequently an individual, whose
tonation is faultless in singing, cannot whistle such a simple melody
as the national anthem without coming to grief.</p>

<p>Here are two useful points always observed by Mr. Capper.</p>

<p>The first is never to laugh when performing. The veriest novice
knows that his risibilities must be well under control before he can
whistle a single note, so that it is essential for him&mdash;no matter what
funny incident is noticed and appeals to him&mdash;to hold tight to his gravity.</p>

<p>The second is that lip-salves should be strictly avoided, as they
render the lips susceptible to cracks and cold; besides, they make a
film which sticks and prevents clear whistling.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XVIII</b><br />
BUNKUM ENTERTAINMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Cuckoo of Society</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been asserted that the noun &#8220;bunkum&#8221; is first cousin to the
verb &#8220;to bunk.&#8221; If so, the dealer in bunkumisms disdains the connection
until matters grow too hot for him at the end of a performance,
when, as a last resource, he hugs his relative gladly. Cupboard affection
this, and in order to shelter himself from the righteous wrath of the
audience, achieves a flying bunk from the platform.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;bunkum&#8221; is interesting. It is defined in the dictionary
as &#8220;speech spoken merely to please one&#8217;s supporters or constituents
and secure their votes&mdash;mere talk.&#8221; It originates from &#8220;Buncombe,
a district in North Carolina, with a constituency, to please whom a
member of theirs once boasted he made a speech in Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunkum covers a wider field than science, woman&#8217;s suffrage, or
politics. It is an autocrat that stands aloof, and demands the gentle
hearts of greenhorn and sage alike for its sacrificial fires. It endeavors
to prove that the age of miracles has not been choked out of existence
beneath the widespread fingers of civilization, or how could an orange
be transformed before our eyes into a cauliflower, an egg into a peeled
potato ?</p>

<p>The bunkum entertainer molds the brains of the most iron-headed
cynic into putty, and transforms the scoffing jeers of the know-all schoolboy
into humble admiration. He is a quack sorcerer, and, even while
we designate him as such, we are obliged to own that his art is steeped
in deepest mystery.</p>

<p>The bunkum entertainer is a parasite, a cartoonist, and mimic, a
smooth-tongued, unscrupulous rascal, who deserves&mdash;the conscientious
entertainer (who never tries bunkum because he is too stupid and wool-headed)
so has it&mdash;to be banished to a desert island and served to cannibals
as minced donkey flesh &#8220;&agrave; la bunkum.&#8221; He is the sort of man
who borrows five pound notes, gold watches, and diamond rings from
his audience, and forgets to return them. He cheats, deludes, patters,
lies by the yard, swallows enough solid materials to furnish a warehouse,
and give an ostrich indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span></p>

<p>He is tough and brazen, and cheaply cynical at the expense of the
authentic conjurer, juggler, phrenologist, ventriloquist, seer, and
spiritualist. He is the cuckoo of society. He concocts a potpourri
of brains and wit, and offers it as his own; and yet, in spite of it all,
how fascinating and overwhelming is his personality. He is the fool
of the world&mdash;the jester who prances about in cap and bells, who
causes our sides to ache in our futile effort to keep our risibilities
decorously pitched. Never did a folly play pitch and toss with the
pedantic phrases of solemn courtiers, kings and prelates, as ably
and irreverently as this monster incarnate with the five senses of
mankind.</p>

<p>He is wrapped in mystery. We regard him with awe and wonder:
the curtains, the table, the walls, the footlights are his faithful agents.
We gaze at the rabbit popping up from his hat, the watch flicked
through a pistol barrel to the wall, the inane jack of diamonds darting
from his mouth to the back of his coat, in trembling amazement of his
cunning. We whisper to our beating hearts, &#8220;Can such things be?&#8221;
At that instant he throws aside the cloak of secrecy, and shows us his
glaring infidelity. He has not, as we supposed, ruptured and mastered
every law of gravitation and nature. He has simply been dealing in
the art of &#8220;bunkum,&#8221; and, when he reveals his methods to us, as he
never fails to do in a continuous prattle of artless confidence, we see&mdash;or
we think we see&mdash;that it is all child&#8217;s play and foolish absurdity.</p>

<p>The rabbit has not been suddenly created, full-grown, in the crown
of his immaculate silk hat. It owes its mild behavior to constant discipline,
its sleek coat to cabbage leaves. Like Topsy&mdash;like all other
bipeds, quadrupeds and aquatic creatures&mdash;it has simply &#8220;growed.&#8221;
Its cage is behind the stage, to which it will presently be spirited away,
to rest in peace after its labors.</p>

<p>When we discover this we become very wide-awake, very &#8220;cute.&#8221;
We will see through the next trick or perish in the attempt. Alas!
alas! for our righteous determination; once again we are deluded and
snared. The table performs a giddy reel, the watch of the confiding
benign bald-headed gentleman in the corner is shattered before our
eyes, and with a thrill of horror we strain our necks to gaze in his
direction in order to witness the anticipated apoplectic seizure.</p>

<p>The gentleman, however, remains stolidly non-committal. My
young schoolboy eyes observe a whitening of the gills, a compression
of the lower jaw that bodes ill for the entertainer if he does not make
good the loss; and a few minutes after he is bidden of the smiling
performer to look in his pocket, and, lo and behold! the monogrammed
watch, which we are ready to swear we saw him pass to the platform,
dangles safely from the end of the chain spanning his stomach. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
shattered timepiece, we are told glibly, was only a base imitation in tin
and glass.</p>

<p>But how, where, in what manner? queries my boyish soul, steeped
in perplexity; and, by-and-by, the monster answers all these questions
as if he read that inner inquisitive voice so satisfactorily that I go home
and try the trick before an admiring circle of friends, borrowing my
maiden aunt&#8217;s watch for the purpose, she being quite unaware that I
have its threepenny duplicate in my pocket.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sure of Success</span></h3>

<p>I am sure of success. I imitate the performer&#8217;s patronizing complacency
perfectly. I smile and sneer politely with all his evil suavity,
and then I fire my pistol, shatter the glass of the threepenny, and my
aunt rises from her chair with a piercing shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, you little wretch, what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>With an airy smile I bid her be calm, and from the rear part of my
person produce with a deft movement her precious belonging.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your watch, madam,&#8221; I say, with all the superior pleasantry of
the &#8220;bunkum&#8221; performer.</p>

<p>Then the smile freezes on my face, the timepiece feels strangely
light in my clammy hand. I gaze at it in horror. My eyeballs distend,
my heart swings backwards and forwards between my ribs. I have
bungled! The good watch is shattered beyond hope of redemption.
The disc of paper and glass cowers up at me, its hands stretched confusedly
across its impudent face.</p>

<p>Disgrace and ignominy descend swiftly upon me. My maiden aunt
prepares to leave the house, declaring she will never enter it again.
My parents, who expect great things at her demise, beseech her forgiveness
in vain. I am banished from the firelit circle to my own room,
up to which a step presently approaches, striding away from the disorder
and hysterics downstairs. My father enters with a long slender implement
behind his back&mdash;an implement which, from former experience,
I know portends woe terrific.</p>

<p>I draw the curtain&mdash;I am chastised and broken in body and spirit.
For a whole week I keep severely aloof from the awful bunkum tyrant,
and then, alas! I am drawn again to the hall, where he is performing
as remorselessly as the silly fly is drawn to enmesh himself in the spider&#8217;s
web.</p>

<p>The next time I played a trick on my family I took good care it
should be of a kind that would do no one&mdash;not even the most hypersensitive
individual&mdash;any harm. Needless to say, my aunt was not of
the circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Thought-Reading Extraordinary</span></h3>

<p>I told them briefly and airily that I was now about to exhibit my
wonderful skill in thought-reading. Perhaps I should add that my
sister Jane, who adores me, was chosen as my confederate. Bidding
them fix on a number, which I would at once discover by the simple
means of placing my fingers on their temples, I withdrew with a bland
smile into the passage.</p>

<p>When I returned they giggled a little, and one twelve-year-old cynic
of the opposite sex piped out <span class="nowrap">scornfully&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never guess it, Tom. You can&#8217;t possibly&mdash;so there.&#8221;</p>

<p>This maiden, often a thorn in my flesh, I silenced with a severe
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, I must request the audience to be perfectly silent,
to concentrate their minds&mdash;those of you who possess them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I
paused to scowl at my pink-and-white torment&mdash;&#8220;concentrate them absolutely
on the chosen number. I am not going to <i>guess</i> it. I am going
to discover it by means of thought transference, and, as the strain
is very great, I must ask you to be perfectly silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like having our photo taken,&#8221; whispered the torment, but some
one bumped her ribs, and she was reluctantly silent.</p>

<p>Solemnly, slowly, I moved round the circle. With drawn brows
and narrowed eyes I placed my fingers lightly on the temples of my
father, mother, uncle, and friends in succession, and then I reached
Jane. She set her teeth just as I had shown her, and I felt the muscles
at her temples work steadily. Having counted ten vibrations, I went
on stolidly to the other heads until the circle was completed. Then,
standing before them, I wiped the imaginary sweat of fatigue from my
brow. The torment looked radiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know it? There&mdash;I said so, Tom, you goose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I returned with a bow, &#8220;the digit fixed upon was
ten!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tableau vivant! The complete confusion of the torment, the most
guileless &#8220;bravo&#8221; from Jane, and my uncle&#8217;s audible whisper to my
proud parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s a positive genius!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he looks quite white and tired,&#8221; quoth mamma.</p>

<p>Result&mdash;the promise of a ripping new bicycle from grandpa as a
reward for my merit.</p>

<p>I owed a lot to Jane, who remained my faithful unsuspected confederate
in many other tricks, which gained me a reputation of being
something of an extraordinary phenomenon and possessed of embryo<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
genius. It was delightful to enjoy the giddy pinnacle of fame to which
my female relations raised me.</p>

<p>Another trick that caused much sensation was the following, and,
for any youth who wishes to follow in the footsteps of the great (which
I think some old poet chap&mdash;who had never studied the art of bunkum&mdash;remarked
are written &#8220;on the sands of Time,&#8221;) I will state clearly
the manner in which it was done.</p>

<p>Place three corks on the table, and tell your wondering home circle
that, while you withdraw, they may touch one of them, and you will
tell them which cork they touched. Your confederate must classify
them as top, middle, and bottom.</p>

<p>When you return, do not look at her fixedly, but just once through
the tail of your eye. If you observe her brush her hair carelessly
from her forehead, you may safely conclude that the top cork is the
one that has been touched. If she picks an imaginary speck from
her nose or blows it, it is the middle cork. If she scratches her chin
pensively, it is the bottom cork. She must take care not to prolong
the process, and you must see at once (without appearing to do so) the
hint conveyed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fake Ventriloquism</span></h3>

<p>By-and-by, delighted with my many successes, I studied and exhibited
the difficult art of ventriloquism. Jane and I, after long saving
of pocket-money and hoarding of occasional tips&mdash;bestowed by kindly
relatives, susceptible to hints&mdash;succeeded in purchasing a dilapidated doll
from a second-hand dealer, and, mastering the anatomy of its joints,
produced it, seated in the place of honor in front of a curtained receptacle
in which Hyde, our servant, was cramped with a mouth organ,
glass of water, straw and other apparatus, carefully schooled beforehand
as to cues and the order of utensils to be used. Or in place of
a lay figure, another boy seated in the chair, and appropriately dressed,
can act as dummy (<a href="#Fig18_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The bunkum ventriloquist must insert his hand in the hole at the
back of the dummy, so that he can move his head and limbs as desired.
He must also convey the appearance of throwing his voice outward from
his chest, boots or stomach, without opening his lips except when addressing
the dummy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; said I very grandly, &#8220;I am about to
exhibit to you some marvelous feats to illustrate faithfully the psychological
force which mind exerts over matter. This gentleman has
spent thousands of years in an African tomb. He was buried on his
face, and that accounts for his battered nose, while it typifies the
greatness of the position he occupied in 15 <span class="allcaps smcap">B.C.</span>,
when it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
custom to put corpses of royal blood with their features compressed
against the bottom of their coffins. You would much prefer to hear his
story from his own lips, and this he will now relate at my <span class="nowrap">persuasion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Androde!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde (in a far away husky voice): &#8220;Noble lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The audience here wish to know something of your experiences
previous to your long
confinement in the willy
waily tomb on the Timbuctoo
plains.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Hyde bubbles the
water through the straw.)</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s overcome with
emotion. These are tears
trickling through the
floodgates.&#8221; (Produce
handkerchief and wipe
them away.)</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, old
chappie, don&#8217;t cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde (huskily):
&#8220;When I think of the
sand and the worms, I
can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about
them. Tell us about the
Palace Mahom&eacute; in which
you lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde: &#8220;It was very
beautiful&mdash;flowers, fountains,
fruit, and baccy as
much as I could consoom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde&#8217;s pronunciation is somewhat faulty, but I excuse this by
saying that poor Androde has not sufficient air in his sand-choked lungs
to pronounce clearly.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig18_1">

<img src="images/illo132.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="536" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Fake ventriloquism.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>&#8220;And there were birds, were there not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde (sadly): &#8220;The air was thick with them, noble lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you recall the note of the Timbuctoo owl?&#8221;</p>

<p>(Figure lost in pondering. Head bent, hand raised to temple in
Shakespearean attitude; lifts his face, mouth opened in a wide grin.)</p>

<p>Hyde: &#8220;It all comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a specimen of the owl.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>(Pause. Dummy thinks hard, and Hyde blows mouthpiece. I
then call upon him to imitate the Timbuctoo lion, and Hyde growls
through a glass chimney, swayed backwards and forwards, and renders
excellent imitation.)</p>

<p>I need not narrate our further conversation. The young bunkum
entertainer can concoct something probably far more idiotic himself.
He may dish up puns, tell funny tales, ask riddles, &amp;c., and, so long
as his patter is bright, amusing, and illustrated by as many funny
jerks and head-turnings of his dummy as he can squeeze into the
entertainment, he will keep a house party amused for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>My figure is not always posed as an unearthed royal mummy from
the plains of Timbuctoo. Sometimes I dress him as a coster-boy,
chimney-sweep, or gentleman in evening dress. Not infrequently he
appears as a clown in tight linen skull-cap and red stockings; and a
quick change into my mother&#8217;s old dress, renovated by Jane, transforms
him from an awkward-limbed hoyden to a demure old lady.</p>

<p>This dressing need not cost the performer anything. He has only
to unearth a linen bag, containing remnants and articles of outgrown
clothing, to work the miracle. A dummy should have as many different
costumes as Queen Elizabeth. They will all come in handy, and add
novelty to the entertainment.</p>

<p>If the cost of procuring a dummy is beyond the performer&#8217;s purse&mdash;as
it was beyond mine for quite a considerable time&mdash;he may engage
a confederate to walk, behave, and talk automatically, conceal his face
in mask and wig, and render a clever and ludicrous performance. This,
however, needs considerable rehearsing and care.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Three Old Maids</span></h3>

<p>An item that makes for novelty and change in an evening&#8217;s performance
is the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Secure three young girls&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean kidnap them, but use your
masculine powers of persuasion. (I find the majority of women folk
need little when it&#8217;s a matter of dressing up and showing off to hilarious
friends.) This is a digression.</p>

<p>Each damsel must have an old woman&#8217;s mask, the uglier the better,
secured at the back of her head by means of elastics, which are easily
hidden by her hair. She must wear a long skirt that conceals her feet,
the back part of it covered by a small apron.</p>

<p>Her hands, in mittens, should be clasped behind her over a stick.
To hide the edge of the mask, some fluffy headgear is essential, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
as a lace fascinator with a rose or two fixed at the side, which is
folded crosswise over the back of her shoulders and frames the
mask.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig18_2">

<img src="images/illo134.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="490" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The Three Old Maids of Lee.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Place the three behind a curtain. When all is ready&mdash;and the performers
should take care to stand perfectly still, for fear of disclosing
the masked profiles at the back of their heads&mdash;the curtain is drawn,
and they sing to a pianoforte accompaniment a verse of &#8220;We are three
young maids of Lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The onlookers will probably designate this &#8220;pretty, but rather tame.&#8221;
This is where the fun comes in, for no one is prepared for the grand
finale. At the end of the verse the maidens step backwards in
a row and retire behind the curtain, or turn round with their masks
to the audience, their heads thrown well over the hands holding the
sticks (<a href="#Fig18_2">Fig. 2</a>). When they are ready the curtain
is again drawn, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
amid shrieks of merriment, the last verse is sung by voices as cracked,
discordant, and out of tune as possible&mdash;&#8220;We are three old maids of
Lee.&#8221; The hands and heads should quiver with old age, the figures be
bowed over the sticks. The result is ludicrous to a degree, and never
fails to delight the unprepared audience.</p>

<p>I once saw an old dowager duchess, severe in full consciousness of
war-paint and feathers, nearly burst the diamond snap of her necklace
with laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle presented. Its great
advantage is that it is cheap and easy, and can be performed without
any rehearsing, by inviting three girls from the audience and spending
a few minutes in instructions behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If you do not know them well enough to presume so far upon their
good-nature, call up three chums of your own sex, array them in feminine
apparel, and the result is even more ludicrous, if more expensive,
for in this case you will require wigs to hide their cropped heads for
the first verse, and dressing them will need more time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bunkum Lectures</span></h3>

<p>I have frequently amused my long-suffering friends and relatives by
Bunkum Lectures. For example, one on Toe and Cornology, quite an
original science, gives scope for the most idiotic remarks on the characteristic
traits portrayed by toes.</p>

<p>For my lecture I have an easel, covered with a block of thin paper
perforated at the top, so that the sheets are easily torn off. On these
I rapidly sketch in turn different types of toes in chalk.</p>

<p>If the entertainer is unable to draw, he can probably persuade an
artist friend to sketch the members required beforehand. In this case
the sheets need not be perforated, but simply thrown over the top of
the easel as he exhibits the different drawings. An easel is soon constructed,
and can be made at home out of soap boxes by the amateur
carpenter; or the block of paper may be placed on a music-stand.</p>

<p>I begin my lecture by a short treatise on toes. I show diagrams
of (1) the President&#8217;s toe, (2) the prelate&#8217;s toe, (3) the courtier&#8217;s
toe, (4) the tyrant&#8217;s toe, (5) the toady&#8217;s toe, (6) the artisan&#8217;s toe,
(7) the neurotic toe, (8) the spiteful toe, (9) the cringing toe, (10) the
poetic toe, (11) the melancholy toe, (12) the absurd toe, (13) the
philanthropic toe, (14) the corn-riddled toe. Here I try to be witty,
and remark that some people of an original turn of mind wear their
corns on their noses instead of inside their boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;The corn is precious&mdash;we all need corn; we make a great to-do
when our corn is oppressed by taxes, for we cherish it. There is
nothing&mdash;not even his wife or twin babes&mdash;so dear to the heart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
necessary to the well-being of man as corn. Corn means bread. Bread
is the staff of life. The man with corn (a corn) is grateful for the
prop of the staff, so that to have a corn sprouting on your big toe should
be no hardship.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a convenience. It is tinned for consumption in your boot,
out of reach of Tariff Reformers and Free Traders. It is your own
private property. Sometimes it is trodden on maliciously, but it does
not vanish on that account. There is something obstinate and bull-necked
about the corn&mdash;the more it is trodden on the more it asserts
itself. It is a hot-house plant. It needs a cover of wool, a roof of
boot leather. Under these conditions it thrives like the baby fed on
Mellin&#8217;s food.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand the fuss the unemployed make. Why should
they, when they have such a treasure hidden in their boots? So
long as a citizen possesses this luxury he is an independent man.
What does he want with foreign corn? Ah, my friends, we have
not yet reached the full realization of the tremendous privileges we
inherit. The corn may not yet be ripe for cutting, but every day,
every hour, sees it nearer that perfection which rejoices the heart of
humanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how beneficent nature has become during the last centuries.
The bootless, prehistoric savage had to plant and reap his corn in the
barren fields, while we are provided gratis with an abundant supply
that is likely to last some of us a lifetime.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are, of course, some individuals who have barren, cornless
toes, although I am glad to say they are in a very small minority. I
have taken pains to secure a correct census of the corn-sprouts that
have appeared during the last year, and I find on an average that only
5 per cent. are ignorant of this blessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The uses of a corn crop are too numerous to mention. Its chief
function is its use as a barometer. The man setting out with his wife
and children to spend a day at the seaside should, before starting on
the excursion, consult his booted friend. If it admonishes him severely
he should not ignore its voice. Woe betide him if he does! It is less
disastrous for him to drown his conscience than shut his heart against
the promptings of his corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should he do so, and act upon his determination to spend a long
day on the sands, anticipating a pleasurable bask in the sunshine, dire
catastrophe will befall him. Rain descends in bucketfuls upon him,
his patient wife, and wailing progeny. They return to town drenched
to the skin, and are all laid up with chills, which means a week&#8217;s absence
from the office&mdash;perhaps dismissal by his employer, if he is a clerk,
and a long doctor&#8217;s bill at the end of the month; and who is to blame?<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
Had the man obeyed the mandates of the faithful vegetable protuberance
on his big toe all would have been well.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only individual I am inclined to respect and admire is the
man who cultivates and is led by his corn in all the important affairs
of life. To be without the ripening corn is to miss the greater part
of the meaning and poignancy of existence. The possession of this treasure
causes a man to thread his way gingerly and tactfully through the
city streets. He never blunders or bungles; he is a sensitive, considerate
person, who unconsciously avoids treading upon or coveting the abundant
crops of others. His corn&#8217;s influence is more beneficial than freemasonry
or foreign missions.</p>

<p>&#8220;To gain the sympathies and interest of a fellow-being when you
are in trouble and want his financial aid, don&#8217;t plunge into your story
at once, but approach him gently with the kindly query, &#8216;Have you a
corn?&#8217; If he replies in the affirmative, you may safely intrust him
with your difficulties. If, on the contrary, he negatives your question,
recognize at once that he is a man of dormant sympathies, and don&#8217;t
waste further time upon him. It will be useless. He is a cornless
individual, therefore heartless.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wind up my discourse with some such remark as <span class="nowrap">this&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, turn away from the pernicious tyrants who
seek to rob you of your birthright in advertising corn salves and plasters.
They are wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing. They are jealous and embittered
by the barrenness of their toe pastures which, do what they
will, yield no corn.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Sharp(?)-Shooter</span></h3>

<p>After this, in order to secure the forgiveness of my hearers for my
opinions and oratory, both pure bunkum, I bring a trick to their
notice, which I work with Hyde, and of which I am rather proud,
because it is quite original and works awfully well, in spite of the fact
that it&#8217;s as simple as the alphabet. For those who would like to try it,
here it <span class="nowrap">is:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Hyde, hidden behind me, is armed with a paper bag inflated with
air. Beforehand I place a used bullet on the floor at the spot at which
I intend aiming my pistol.</p>

<p>I employ some patter to remove the growing alarm of my family,
and the anxiety expressed for themselves, the furniture, and lastly&mdash;my
own person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; I say with self-complacency extreme, &#8220;I
am about to perform a <i>feat</i> with my <i>hands</i>&#8221;&mdash;(joke&mdash;pause&mdash;a flutter
of laughter). &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I say with a polite bow&mdash;&#8220;the like of<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
which has never been seen&mdash;since the making of the world. I will
load and fire this revolver, and the bullet will not only make no mark,
but there will not even be a flash or smoke. You will hear the sound
of the explosion, and I will show you the bullet discharged.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that you may see that there is no bunkum in this marvelous
achievement, I will hand you the bullet before I place it in the barrel
and immediately after I have fired it.&#8221; (Here I pass round unused
bullet. I then place it in full view of the audience in the barrel.)</p>

<p>I retire to the curtain immediately in front of Hyde, and take aim
above the spot where the spent bullet lies. Count aloud &#8220;One, two,
three!&#8221; At three I pretend to pull the trigger, and Hyde brings his
hand forcibly on the paper bag, which causes my audience to bounce
in their chairs.</p>

<p>Then I cross the platform, stoop, pick up the used bullet, hand it
round for inspection, and retire modestly, overcome with glory.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ghost</span></h3>

<p>Occasionally I work a ghost in the following way. After some
patter, in which I inform the onlookers that I am about to conjure
up the shade of some famous
character, I extinguish the
lights, and withdrawing to
a corner of the room, enfold
myself in a long black
mackintosh or coat that
shrouds my head and figure
completely.</p>

<p>I strike a match behind
the curtain, and, when I
have a good spark that will
last a few seconds, blow out
the flame, and hold the end
of the match between my
teeth, so that my mouth is
lit up (<a href="#Fig18_3">Fig. 3</a>). My lips are
drawn in a fiendish grin,
and I strike an attitude,
accompanied by inhuman
moans and drum-beating
from Hyde.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig18_3">

<img src="images/illo138.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="390" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The Ghost.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>When the spark dies, I hide the black garment behind the curtain,
and assume the position I occupied before the appearance of the ghost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span></p>

<p>Hyde switches on the light, and my shivering onlookers have no
key to the riddle.</p>

<p>The apparatus employed by the bunkum entertainer and the cost
it entails depend largely upon his own ingenuity. Most of the articles
I employ are of my own manufacture. My wigs do not hail from
a wig-maker&#8217;s, but from the lumber room at the top of our house, where
Jane and I shred disused rope, fix it by means of gum or stitches on
to pieces of stiff book-muslin, shaped so as to fit the head. If other
colors, such as black and red, are required, we resort to aniline dyes,
and the result is much satisfaction to ourselves.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XIX</b><br />
VENTRILOQUISM IN A MONTH</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Practical and Comprehensive Guide to the Art of
Valentine Vox</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one form of entertainment which perhaps makes a stronger
appeal to the average boy and young man than almost any other. It
would not, in a sense, be wrong to say that ventriloquism is, and has
been for a great number of years, the most envied of all accomplishments
incidental to the art of the amateur and semi-professional
entertainer.</p>

<p>True, ventriloquism for many centuries was regarded as an adjunct
to wizardry, and the exponents of black magic, but the great success
achieved by the writer of &#8220;Valentine Vox,&#8221; the central character in
which was endowed with the most wonderful and extraordinary powers
of voice throwing, brought the subject of ventriloquism at once under
general notice, and ever since it has steadily won its way into universal
favor, with the result that, at the present time, it easily eclipses in
popularity most other forms of amusement.</p>

<p>Despite this, however, the misconceptions existing regarding this
branch of vocal phonetics are extraordinarily numerous and widespread,
due, perhaps, in a measure to the fact that the amount of valuable
written instruction on ventriloquism is so small, while the number of
people who have swallowed the fascinating and improbable adventures
dealt with in the book just referred to are correspondingly large.</p>

<p>To a very considerable extent, then, it is the object of this chapter
primarily to dispose of the many existing fallacies concerning ventriloquism,
because by so doing alone is it possible to commence a study of
the subject with the hope of attaining proficiency and success.</p>

<p>The first idea which the would-be ventriloquist has to dismiss from
his mind is that, by following out a stated course of exercises, he will be
able to &#8220;throw&#8221; his voice or, in other words, to upset the equanimity
of peaceable old gentlemen snoring quietly in the furthest corner of the
railway carriage&mdash;or ruffle the temper of some aged lady by producing
facetious remarks concerning her appearance&mdash;from a long distance
away; not that those who approach this subject have any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
desire to be a disturbing influence to other people, but it is safe to say
that more take up ventriloquism with the idea of practical joking than
for any other purpose.</p>

<p>In point of truth, the real art of Valentine Vox does not lend itself
very easily to the production of such illusions; even when the performer
is capable of producing ventriloquial sound, he will discover that the
&#8220;distant&#8221; effect depends almost entirely upon his situation at the
moment of utterance, and whether or not those around him are prepared
to give the credence he desires to his efforts. In other words, a
ventriloquist cannot throw his voice wheresoever he will as if it were
sound bottled up only to come out and be heard when it is some
distance away; the best he can hope for is to make that sound so
deceptive to the ears of his audience that, to them, it seems to come
from some one other than the actual speaker.</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be denied that the stock-in-trade of the clever
ventriloquist is so unusual and superior to that of his fellow-worker in
any other branch of entertainment, that he is capable of producing the
most humorous and arresting situations. Moreover, it is a power which
once gained can never be lost, and although a ventriloquist may, from
various causes, give up the pursuit of his favorite subject for a period
of many years, yet he can pick it up again at the point where he left it
and find himself still possessed of the same wonderful and extraordinary
skill.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">All Born Ventriloquists</span></h3>

<p>Unhappily there are other very prevalent misconceptions to be
removed before instruction can be either given or undertaken. The
marvelous and almost incomprehensible powers attributed by the late
Mr. Henry Cockton to his popular character, doubtless gave rise to the
idea that ventriloquism was a gift natural only to those possessing unusual
formation of the throat and vocal organs. Modern research and investigation,
however, have proved that every one is a born ventriloquist,
that the power to make sounds appear to emanate at a point remote
from the speaker is universal&mdash;and that all those who study the subject
from a proper and sensible standpoint can easily acquire the art.</p>

<p>Then, again, it has long been supposed by the uninitiated that
ventriloquial practice is injurious to the throat, and capable of harming
the lungs. Exactly the opposite is the case; the exercises necessitated
by the proper study of the art are such as will serve not only to train
the vocal organs, but also to induce proper breathing&mdash;a practice
neglected by many&mdash;and to strengthen and invigorate the lungs.</p>

<p>From many years&#8217; personal experience the author can testify to<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
the truth of this fact; he has known a number of young men who,
possessing lung and throat troubles, and acting on the foregoing
advice, have followed out a practical course of ventriloquial training,
and have obtained much material benefit thereby.</p>

<p>Of course it cannot be denied that some possess a natural aptitude
for the correct expression of ventriloquial sound, and it is they
who make the cleverest exponents. Therefore, from the start it should
be assumed that a ventriloquist has only to cultivate the vocal qualifications
with which he has been endowed in order to shine as a
popular entertainer.</p>

<p>Careful and systematic attention to the instructions subjoined will
not only strengthen the throat and respiratory organs, but will also
endow any one young man, or young woman, with the power of giving
a highly amusing entertainment. Probably many who give this
chapter attention will do so with the idea of taking up the subject for
the purpose of making a living, and in that respect it may truthfully
be said that ventriloquism is one of the most paying forms of entertainment.
While the number of conjurors, comic singers, &amp;c., is
legion, those capable of giving a really good ventriloquial entertainment
are comparatively few, with the result that a clever ventriloquist is
always certain of obtaining engagements at fees which he, himself, can
fix and command. The popularity of the subject is so widespread
that the chances of exhibiting it are increasing every year.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Initial Stages</span></h3>

<p>Just as the successful illusionist is called upon to devote many
many hours of his time to the speedy and finished manipulation of
cards, coins, and billiard balls, so the young ventriloquist has an
equally uninteresting course to traverse. It is, however, possible for
the initial stages of the work to be accomplished in less time than is
the case with conjuring, and while the work has to be done all the
same, dry and tiresome though it may be, after it is once accomplished
the performer can put it behind him for ever.</p>

<p>The primary difficulty to be overcome is incorrect breathing.
Possibly nine out of ten, when they come to read this chapter, will
discover that their method of breathing is faulty. Most people, from
lack of proper instruction and through carelessness, breathe through
the mouth&mdash;and this fault must be remedied at once.</p>

<p>For ventriloquism, as with singing, breathing must take place
through the nostrils. The necessity for this&mdash;apart from hygienic
reasons&mdash;is that because the ventriloquist, particularly when he is
performing with a &#8220;lay&#8221; figure, is called upon to conduct a dual<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
conversation, and the supposed interchange of remarks between him
and the automaton is so rapid that mouth breathing would interfere
with the continuous flow of words. Only by taking in deep inhalations
through the nostrils and filling the lungs to their utmost capacity
is it possible to carry on one part of the conversation with moving
lips, and the other with the face immutably set.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breathing Exercises</span></h3>

<p>These should be undertaken regularly every day, preferably early
in the morning and in the open air. Stand erect, shoulders drawn
well back, arms hanging loosely at the sides, and then, closing the
mouth tightly, draw in a deep breath, retaining it for some seconds
in the lungs. Not infrequently it happens, that the ventriloquist
when performing is called upon to keep a conversation going for
quite a minute and a half without the opportunity of recharging the
lung cells with a fresh supply of oxygen; from this it will easily be
understood how important deep and sustained breathing is.</p>

<p>At first difficulty will be experienced in holding the breath for more
than five or six seconds; by the end of a week, after ten minutes&#8217;
practice every morning, the chest will be so expanded and strengthened
that &#8220;half minute breaths&#8221; may be taken with ease. Continue the
practice of this exercise until only one inhalation and exhalation takes
place every forty or fifty seconds. Somewhat dry, indeed, sounds this
part of the ventriloquial study; nevertheless it is of the utmost importance,
and will well repay the time, trouble, and perseverance
devoted to it.</p>

<p>As a number of minor acquirements must be gained before ventriloquial
effects can be produced, the breathing exercises may be alternated
with the most necessary adjunct of learning to speak without
moving the lips.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Automaton&mdash;or Man?</span></h3>

<p>It has previously been said that ventriloquism largely partakes of
the nature of an illusion, and this effect is produced by the performer
uttering sounds without giving visible indications of the fact. Consequently,
when the audience have before them two figures, a live and
a dummy one, and the mouth of the &#8220;dummy&#8221; opens and shuts to
correspond with the words used, whilst the face of the ventriloquist
remains mask-like and passive&mdash;the illusion that it is the &#8220;automaton,&#8221;
and not the man who is speaking, is complete.</p>

<p>So important indeed is the ability to do this properly, that speaking
without facial movement ranks of equal importance with the placing<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
of the vocal chords in such a position that &#8220;distant&#8221; effect is given to
sound. In fact, one might almost say that a most amusing entertainment
can be given without this latter power at all.</p>

<p>Many ventriloquists or polyphonists, as they more correctly designate
themselves, rely solely for their entertainment on a &#8220;knee&#8221; figure
and speech without facial expression.</p>

<p>Those who do not aspire to become really first-class and proficient
ventriloquists may conclude their instruction at this point, and rest
quite assured that they have learned sufficient, at any rate, to give a
creditable drawing-room performance.</p>

<p>Naturally the beginner would like to have some idea of the time it
would take to gain a practical working knowledge of ventriloquism.
Well, the student who would take the trouble and devote sufficient
time to the initial and most difficult stages of the work would be in a
position to give a very creditable performance long before his painstaking
brother who, as fast as he seems to be getting on, will find he
has to go back again and again over the early ground.</p>

<p>However, after devoting say a week to the elementary stages, a
&#8220;knee&#8221; figure might be purchased, and within a very few days a
private entertainment might safely be entered upon. As, however, the
course herewith outlined will take in several different kinds of &#8220;voices&#8221;
for automata, together with the various modifications of the &#8220;distant&#8221;
voice, the student should not expect to gain proficiency under a month.
Of course, to give a really finished entertainment consisting of an
exhibition of the &#8220;near&#8221; and &#8220;distant&#8221; voices, together with instrumental
and vocal mimicry equal in skill to the average product of the
professional entertainer, many months&#8217; practice are required.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Speaking with Still Lips</span></h3>

<p>A study of the alphabet reveals that difficulties lie in the path of
pronouncing certain letters&mdash;a, e, i, o, u, c, d, g, h, j, k, l, n, q, r, s, t, x,
and z&mdash;issue from the mouth quite easily; but b, f, m, p, v, w, y all
make a demand upon the muscles of the lips and cheeks. Unfortunately
these letters often recur in ordinary speech, and as it is almost impossible
to speak them distinctly without facial movement, appropriate vocal
substitutes have to be made.</p>

<p>On the border line is &#8220;b,&#8221; which is generally pronounced by bringing
the upper row of teeth down to the under lip and forcing the
breath out between the lip and teeth; by giving greater force to the
exhalation, and, opening the mouth, it will be found that almost identically
the same sound can be gained, and it is this one which has to be
used for all words commencing with &#8220;v&#8221; and &#8220;b.&#8221; Thus the word<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
&#8220;brother&#8221; is really pronounced ventriloquially as &#8220;vruther&#8221;; in the
hurry of conversation the substitution passes notice, and the audience
hear only the correct word.</p>

<p>For &#8220;f&#8221; an accentuated aspirate makes a very passable substitution&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
&#8220;fool&#8221; becomes &#8220;hool,&#8221; &#8220;feel&#8221; becomes &#8220;heel,&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>&#8220;m&#8221; will be found rather more difficult, but if the lips are formed
into an orifice, and the breath drawn sharply in, the sound of the &#8220;m&#8221;
can be made inside the mouth instead of by the lips.</p>

<p>As it is almost an impossibility to sound the initial &#8220;p&#8221; unless the
lips come together, words commencing with it should be studiously
avoided. Another plan is to drop the first letter altogether; but the
former is the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;w&#8221; is amenable to a little tongue-twisting, and is accomplished by
moving the tongue twice in quick succession to the roof of the mouth
making the sound at the back of the throat. This is as regards the
letter itself, but words commencing with &#8220;w&#8221; are quite easy. Practice
on &#8220;which,&#8221; &#8220;when,&#8221; &#8220;what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;y,&#8221; however, is a fairly certain test, and if you can comfortably
manage this without betraying the fact to the looking-glass (before
which you should carry out your practice) then you have mastered
a great difficulty. A quick exhalation should take place while words
commencing with it are being uttered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Two Kinds of Ventriloquism</span></h3>

<p>Ventriloquism may be divided into two classes&mdash;the first and more
easy of acquirement known as &#8220;near,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i> including all those vocal
illusions produced with the aid of automata; and &#8220;distant,&#8221; which
takes in the various illusions achieved by what is known as &#8220;throwing
the voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The most finished exponent of both these branches, of this or any
other age, was the great Lieutenant Walter Cole, and he introduced into
his entertainment such an exquisite blending of the two styles that his
example might well be imitated by other followers of the art.</p>

<p>When carrying on an animated conversation with the &#8220;lay&#8221; figures
placed at near quarters the proceedings would suddenly be interrupted
by the low sound of voices coming from afar, and this would gradually
increase in volume as the speakers were supposed to draw near, until at
last they would be heard outside the very room in which the entertainment
was taking place.</p>

<p>This is alluded to now, as showing the latitude which ventriloquism
allows its exponents.</p>

<p>Of the two branches, &#8220;near&#8221; ventriloquism is much the simpler<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
to acquire, although some might hold that, in order to justify the title,
&#8220;distant&#8221; sounds should first be mastered.</p>

<p>For the purpose of adding interest to the work, students are
recommended to give precedence to the &#8220;near&#8221; effects. Briefly, the
&#8220;near&#8221; voices come from the mouth, the &#8220;distant&#8221; from the throat.</p>

<p>For the former five modified voices are generally used. These are:
&#8220;The old man,&#8221; &#8220;the old woman,&#8221; &#8220;the little boy,&#8221; &#8220;the little girl,&#8221;
and &#8220;the darky&#8221; or &#8220;the longshoreman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first is a foundation for the last two. It has been spoken of as
the &#8220;grunt,&#8221; because, being the vocal production of an aged and uneducated
man, in its initial stages it much resembles the familiar
grunting of a pig.</p>

<p>And here it should be noted that the speech of ventriloquial figures
is always harsh and toneless because the efforts to produce the sound
in the mouth without moving the lips rob them of that music and
modulation invariably associated with the speech of educated persons.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to speak ventriloquially, as you would naturally
but slur the endings of your words. Grunt and drag them out slowly,
just as do many countrymen and those unacquainted with the rules of
proper speech.</p>

<p>To give the sound the necessary depth and loudness, keep the lips
slightly apart, the tongue lying loosely in the mouth; then make the
grunt, using some vowel sound like &#8220;ah!&#8221; fairly far back.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the vocal chords will have to be contracted and
the chin drawn slightly down into the chest.</p>

<p>At first only a spasmodic jerkiness of the breath will come, but
after a little practice &#8220;ah!&#8221; can be said quite easily, and then other and
longer words follow as a matter of course.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Old Woman&#8217;s Voice</span></h3>

<p>Known as the &#8220;theek&#8221; or &#8220;rush&#8221; voice, it partakes of the nature of
the squeaky, shrill sound produced by a reed instrument. Most people
are gifted with the power of singing &#8220;falsetto,&#8221; and the &#8220;theek&#8221; voice
simply consists of falsetto tones somewhat exaggerated. Either the
words &#8220;queek&#8221; or &#8220;theek&#8221; may be used for the preliminary practice,
the latter perhaps being preferable.</p>

<p>As it is not intended in these chapters to enter into a practical
discourse on the anatomy of the throat and vocal chords, technical
terms relating to such will be avoided as far as possible. However,
the larynx must now be mentioned&mdash;this is the part of the throat often
spoken of as Adam&#8217;s apple, and is the convex portion of the first
cartilage of the larynx. It is, then, this part of the larynx that has to<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
be compressed by muscular contraction in order to give the &#8220;theek&#8221;
voice its proper quality; by a slight pressure with the hand on the
&#8220;apple&#8221; you will realize the position which this part of the throat
should occupy when muscular contraction takes place.</p>

<p>Now, taking in a deep breath and contracting the larynx, it will
naturally curl up the tongue, until the tip presses tightly against the
roof of the mouth. Open the lips fairly wide and say the word
&#8220;theek&#8221; in a high-pitched falsetto tone, sustaining the vowel sound
as long as you can.</p>

<p>Your first efforts will probably end in dismal failure, but after a
few attempts the full sound settles down to the long drawn-out sound
of full roundness and tone.</p>

<p>Now you have acquired the &#8220;theek&#8221; voice, which is also the basis
of the voices used with the figures of little boys and little girls.</p>

<p>Very possibly your practice in the elementary stages of ventriloquism
will result in a slight soreness of the throat. To alleviate this, and, at
the same time, to strengthen the vocal chords, gargle with a weak solution
of salt and water, or better still, get a druggist to make up a gargle
for you.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the mere effort of gargling is in itself a valuable
aid to the production of ventriloquism, inasmuch as the subject is
forced to emit sounds while the water is in the throat, and these will
be found to possess quite a &#8220;distant&#8221; effect.</p>

<p>Having mastered the &#8220;grunt&#8221; and &#8220;theek&#8221; voices, use words
consisting of vowels, changing the words into sentences as progress
is made.</p>

<p>At this point the young ventriloquist is sufficiently well equipped to
undertake a public exhibition of his powers, and this being so, it is
perhaps better to make mention of ventriloquial figures before the
remaining &#8220;near&#8221; voices are dealt with.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the practice of ventriloquism in its earlier stages
is not the most interesting of occupations, and not until the beginner
awakens to the full realization of his powers&mdash;as he does only when
he is working with automata&mdash;is the real fascination of the art felt.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ventriloquial Figures</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps it is hardly right to assume that every one has seen a
ventriloquial figure; certainly many will be unacquainted with its
peculiarities and modes of working.</p>

<p>The dummy is usually a humorous representation of some grotesque
character&mdash;an old man, with strongly accentuated peculiarities,
such as a red nose, wrinkled skin, and big jaws; an old woman, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
thin, pointed nose, sharp eyes, and scanty locks; a little boy grinning
saucily, and having the appearance of possessing the wisdom of all the
ages; the little &#8220;miss,&#8221; of perky manner; the good-natured, rollicking
black man; and the longshoreman, square jowled and cheeky.</p>

<p>The one essential about the ventriloquial figure is that it shall have
a moving mouth. In reality the chin is cut away from the face, and
the movable portion working on a pivot or string, gives the same effect
as when a person is speaking.</p>

<p>There are many different forms of ventriloquial figures, some of
which are shown on this page (<a href="#Fig19_1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig19_2">2</a>), but for the amateur the
kind which possesses only a moving mouth is quite suitable.</p>

<div class="figleft w300" id="Fig19_3">

<img src="images/illo149.png" alt="" width="300" height="397" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Showing construction of
ventriloquial head.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>By means of a little ingenuity and the expenditure of a few cents
a movable tuft of hair may be added to the wig, but as the working of
this is liable at first somewhat to hamper the manipulation of the
automaton, it should perhaps be left until proficiency is more assured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
The hole in the back of the head or body permits of the hand of the
performer pressing either upon a plate or upon a circle of wire, which
in turn moves down the movable mouth, closing automatically by
means of a spring. <a href="#Fig19_3">Figs. 3</a>, <a href="#Fig19_4">4</a>
and <a href="#Fig19_5">5</a> respectively show the construction
of ventriloquial figure heads
and another principle of ventriloquial
figure manipulation.</p>

<p>The number of mouth movements
made by the figure should,
of course, coincide as nearly as
possible with the number made by
the mouth in ordinary speech; thus
a natural effect will be gained.</p>

<p>Placing a &#8220;dummy&#8221; on each
knee, the ventriloquist opens up an
amusing conversation. The aim of
the figures is to destroy the effect of
the performer&#8217;s remarks by the interpolation
of absurd interruptions.
The whole matter resolves itself into
a witty dialogue between three or
four people, of whom the entertainer
is the central character. Such a
dialogue should be brisk and sparkling
with humor, all vulgarity being
carefully eliminated. It is as well to write the dialogue out and learn
it by heart.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ventriloquial Figure Manipulation</span></h3>

<p>Always adhere to a prearranged order of ventriloquial figures.
If you commence your entertaining career with the old man on the
right knee and the old woman on the left, keep to that arrangement
all along. A change will inevitably result in putting the wrong voice
into the wrong mouth, and the result will be disastrous.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that all the while the endeavors of the figures are
to make <i>you</i> appear ridiculous in the eyes of the audience, and they
should turn all your sensible remarks into nonsensical ones, so that the
laugh is always against yourself. Of course the audience will join
in the laugh against you, and it is the taking of this in the proper
spirit that will signalize your success as a ventriloquist.</p>

<p>When putting words into the mouth of an automaton, its face
should be turned towards you; inversely, whilst you yourself are
talking the automaton should be engaged in looking curiously about<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
him at the audience, as if taking not the slightest interest in your
remarks. Suddenly, however, he will snatch the opportunity of
scoring off you, to the great enjoyment of his partner, the old woman.</p>

<p>Immediately you have
finished speaking in your
natural voice, keep your
lips absolutely fixed during
the time the figure is
supposed to be talking.</p>

<p>It is not proposed
here to give specimens
of ventriloquial dialogue,
because the humor of
these depends so much
upon the natural ability
of the performer in presenting
the joke or funny
story.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best
plan is to form a cutting-book
out of the tit-bits
extracted from the humorous periodicals of the day, and to paste
them in. In this way a voluminous collection of anecdotes, tales,
and riddles will be made, and by a judicious
combination and selection of these,
enough material can be speedily gained
to last months without fear of repetition.</p>

<p>The most entertaining form of presenting
riddles is for the &#8220;old man&#8221; or
&#8220;little boy,&#8221; whichever is being used, to
propound them, and the entertainer to
give some practical answer to them. The
real point of the joke should be brought
out by the &#8220;lay&#8221; figure, to the accompaniment
of considerable mirth.</p>

<p>Home-made automata are not recommended,
because the cost of purchasing
really serviceable &#8220;dummies&#8221; is so small
as not to make it worth while spending
a deal of time and trouble, to say
nothing of money, on their construction. Moreover, the great point
about the &#8220;lay figure&#8221; is that it should possess a funny face, and
such expressions are rather difficult for an amateur to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span></p>

<p>Many entertainment emporiums deal largely in ventriloquian outfits,
and reliable &#8220;dolls&#8221; ought to be procured fully dressed for about $5
each.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Voice for &#8220;Little Boy&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>When a child speaks he almost invariably does so in a high-pitched
tone, more or less directing the sound through his nose.
This being so, the &#8220;theek&#8221; voice is the one most suitable for him.
The similarity between it and the speech used for the &#8220;old woman&#8221;
may be avoided by speaking in a somewhat lower tone, and in a
simpler and more disjointed fashion.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that you ask the little boy a question?
Get him to repeat that question after you, and give the answer in
short, jerky, broken sentences.</p>

<p>For the &#8220;little girl&#8221; use a slightly higher tone, without directing
the sound through the nose. In her case also the mode of expression
must be childish, but with slightly more refinement.</p>

<p>The voice for the &#8220;longshoreman&#8221; and the &#8220;darky&#8221; are both of
the &#8220;grunt&#8221; order. For the former, the &#8220;old man&#8221; voice is used, with
the addition of the peculiar &#8220;tough&#8221; twang; whilst for the latter, employ
speech of a much lower and more resonant tone.</p>

<p>Place the chords as when using the &#8220;grunt&#8221; voice, breathing rather
heavily, and force the sound as far back in the throat as possible, at
the same time contracting the muscles of the stomach while the breath
is being expelled.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;yah! yah!&#8221; is a very good one upon which to practice,
and the vowel sound should be sustained to some length.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Distant&#8221; Voices</span></h3>

<p>By this time the young ventriloquist should have attained sufficient
proficiency in the art of manipulating &#8220;knee&#8221; figures to feel confident
of venturing on the far more difficult and relatively more important
&#8220;distant&#8221; voices.</p>

<p>The real test of ventriloquial power is when the performer is
capable of making sounds appear to come from a distance, <i>i.e.</i> so
modify his utterances that they appear to the audience to proceed from
some point remote both from the entertainer and from themselves.</p>

<p>The basis of real ventriloquism, as apart from polyphony, <i>i.e.</i>
&#8220;near&#8221; effects, is known as the &#8220;bee drone,&#8221; because the first sound
of which the vocal chords are capable when placed in the required
position much resembles the droning of a bee in full flight.</p>

<p>The &#8220;bee drone&#8221; should be practiced in loosely fitting clothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
so that neither the muscles of the throat nor of the chest are unduly
hampered.</p>

<p>From a natural, upright position, inhale in a short, jerky manner,
making what is best described as a retching noise at the back of the
throat. Unpleasant as the practice of this undoubtedly is for the first
few minutes, after a short while the noise emitted will settle down to
a softly sustained hum. The tongue should lie flat, so that the sound
waves produced partly in the larynx and partly in the back of the
throat are forced upwards by the action of the abdominal muscles and
directed towards the roof of the mouth, the latter acting somewhat as
a sounding board&mdash;modifying the sound and conveying to the ears of
a listener some distance away a &#8220;distant&#8221; effect.</p>

<p>The continuous practice of the word &#8220;ah,&#8221; with the vocal chords
in the position just described, will speedily produce the necessary
droning quality.</p>

<p>It remains now only by a contraction of the throat to regulate the
quality of the tone and the distance from which you wish it to appear
to come.</p>

<p>From this point progress will be found rapid and satisfactory.
The various modifications of the bee drone produce respectively,</p>

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="noindent blankbefore75">1. <i>The &#8220;roof&#8221; voice.</i><br />
2. <i>The &#8220;level&#8221; voice.</i><br />
3. <i>The &#8220;floor&#8221; voice.</i></p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="blankbefore75">The &#8220;roof&#8221; voice is extremely useful for illusions of all kinds, and
perhaps is the easiest of the three to acquire. Its purpose is to make
sound appear to come from any point above the audience, and the
entertainer practices it at first by standing erect, taking in a deep
breath, and then drawing backwards and downwards the lower jaw,
holding it by muscular contraction in that position. With the lips
about an inch apart say your words, whatever they may be, just as
you would the &#8220;ah!&#8221; of the bee drone, concentrating your mind on
the effort of directing the sound waves towards the roof of the mouth.
In this case, however, exhalation should take place very slowly, while
the speech is uttered with unusual clearness.</p>

<p>The effect of the illusion, however, is destroyed if whilst using the
&#8220;roof&#8221; voice you look either straight before you or down to the
ground.</p>

<p>The ventriloquist must bear in mind that it is important to deceive
the audience, just as a conjurer does, but the former has this
advantage over his magic brother, that the deception is both optical
and oral.</p>

<p>Let him, therefore, when &#8220;throwing his voice&#8221; to the roof, glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
sharply upwards as soon as the words are uttered, and turn his head
in a listening attitude; his example will be followed immediately by
the audience, who naturally fall into the trap prepared for them, and,
for the time being, are quite satisfied that the sounds do really come
from the roof.</p>

<p>This is an advantage on which the ventriloquist can trade to an
enormous extent, because the ear is so easily deceived. How difficult
it is, when listening from within a closed room to a street organ playing
outside, to tell whether the music comes from up or down the road.
So with ventriloquism&mdash;the performer has but to modify the position
of the vocal chords as indicated, and to fix his eyes upon the roof,
when lo and behold! everybody is perfectly satisfied that the speech
<i>does</i> come from above.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Level&#8221; Sounds</span></h3>

<p>Of the three &#8220;distant&#8221; voices, the &#8220;level&#8221; is, perhaps, the most
useful and the most generally successful, because the mere fact of the
entertainer being on the same plane as the door and the windows,
from behind which people are supposed to converse with him, provides
him with opportunities for using the facial muscles and for
distorting sounds, and so heightening the illusion.</p>

<p>For instance, whereas he must turn full or three-quarter face
when using the &#8220;roof&#8221; voice, he can carry on a dialogue on the
&#8220;level,&#8221; sideways to the audience; or in the case where the stage
possesses a door at the rear, he may often be permitted for a moment
to turn his back.</p>

<p>Practice as before in the &#8220;bee drone&#8221; voice, without endeavoring
to any great extent to shut off the sound in the throat. This may be
done by curling up the tongue so that its tip presses against the back
of the upper teeth.</p>

<p>If you are practicing by the side of the door, as you open it towards
you the ventriloquially uttered sounds must be raised in tone and made
more distinct by lifting the shutter from the throat, or, in other words,
by allowing the tongue to resume its normal position, and the sounds
to issue forth on the principle of the &#8220;bee drone.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Floor&#8221; Voice</span></h3>

<p>This voice is extremely useful for such illusions as &#8220;the man in the
cellar attending to the gas meter,&#8221; &amp;c. It calls particularly for a display
of histrionic powers, and the mere fact of bending down, as the sounds
appear to come from below, helps to give it the necessary subdued and
&#8220;distant&#8221; effect. Whilst speaking very slowly in the &#8220;bee drone&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
thrust the chin forward, contracting the larynx as much as you possibly
can; roll back the tongue to stifle the sound in the throat, and the
illusion will be complete. Immediately you change from the &#8220;floor&#8221;
to the natural voice, resume the standing position and speak with
unusual distinctness. The contrast cannot fail to escape the notice
of the audience, who will be quite convinced that you have indeed
carried on a conversation with some one below.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ventriloquial Imitations</span></h3>

<p>Although imitations can hardly be classed under the heading of
pure ventriloquism, yet they may be pressed into the service of the
entertainer to promote variety in his performance. They serve, too,
another very useful purpose, inasmuch as they provide a relief from
what must inevitably prove a strain on the vocal chords. As has
already been said, ventriloquism necessitates the placing of the vocal
chords in a somewhat unnatural position, and the result is that the
exponent, particularly in the early stages of the work, is apt speedily
to become tired.</p>

<p>As a break between an exhibition of &#8220;near&#8221; ventriloquism&mdash;that
is, with the automata&mdash;and an exposition of distant effects, one or
two vocal or instrumental imitations will prove welcome both to the
entertainer and the entertained.</p>

<p>A witty person once remarked that the secret of success lies not so
much in what you can do, as in what you can induce other people to
think you can do. In other words, a little knowledge in the hands of
a ready-witted and competent ventriloquist can be turned to great
advantage and become a valuable asset in his undertakings. For
successful imitations, self-confidence is perhaps of even greater importance
than the possession of real ventriloquial powers. Self-confidence
is a trump card that the ventriloquist should always hold in his
hand, because it will take all the tricks. Success is impossible without
it, and easy with it!</p>

<p>Perhaps there are few branches of entertaining in which self-assurance
is so necessary as in ventriloquial mimicry. The border-line
between a successful imitation and a ludicrous failure is oft-times so
narrow, that a sensitive soul would soon be disheartened.</p>

<p>The only difference between the efforts of the ordinary and the
ventriloquial mimic is that the latter, when giving expression to sounds
vocally produced, should place the chords in the same position as for
the &#8220;bee drone&#8221; and the &#8220;distant&#8221; voice.</p>

<p>A very good study is that of a hen as she cackles immediately
before laying an egg, and again after having done so. You will notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
that the first sounds are mostly of a guttural nature, and they should
come from well back in the throat, starting moderately high and descending
four or five notes. Of course the lips will have to be kept slightly
opened, and for the final jubilant crow considerably extended. To
avoid the necessary facial movement, it is as well when uttering the
&#8220;crow&#8221; to turn sideways to the audience. Again, while the first note
of the cackling should be loud, the successive notes grow quieter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Dog Fight</span></h3>

<p>An imitation of a dog fight will form a spirited item in your programme.
By your actions you may suggest, for instance, a small
cur yapping vigorously until a larger and more ferocious animal
endeavors to quiet him.</p>

<p>To produce the higher notes of the dog-bark, the falsetto or
&#8220;thick&#8221; voice must be used, while the deeper guttural tones already
explained for use with the &#8220;darky&#8221; serve for the larger dog.</p>

<p>It is a little difficult to intersperse the two sets of sounds without
expressing facial contortion, but you may obtain for yourself a certain
amount of license by pretending that the dog fight is taking place
beneath a covered table, behind which you may stoop in your supposed
endeavors to stop the tumult.</p>

<p>It is but natural to turn from dogs to cats. Whereas you have
just given an imitation, perhaps, of a fierce duel, your next effort
should endeavor to portray a feline courtship. This should be made
as funny as possible. The lady&#8217;s &#8220;marr-rr-ows&#8221; and &#8220;mia-a-a-ows&#8221;
are easily copied after you have been kept awake a night or two
listening to the genuine article, whilst the deeper tones of Mr. Tom
are included in the repertory of every well-educated schoolboy.</p>

<p>The mouth should be kept fairly wide open and a kind of sideways
motion given to it, whilst the cry should be drawled until the lips form
for the final &#8220;ow.&#8221; The spittings and growlings necessitate the
bringing together of the lips and teeth, a freedom which your audience
on this occasion must permit you. The doleful moans with which
our feline friends endeavor to solace one another can be produced by
making the mouth very hollow, the lips into the form of a large O,
slowly contracted to a very small one.</p>

<p>For the die-away, distant effect, moaning more or less in the throat
must be resorted to. The finale can consist of a number of fierce
spittings and growlings, suddenly interrupted by an unmistakably
human voice (your own) &#8220;shoo-ing&#8221; the night visitants away.</p>

<p>A variation can be made by giving an imitation of pouring out a
glass of wine. To produce the illusion of drawing the cork from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
bottle, turn slightly round, thrust the forefinger into the mouth against
the cheek, close the lips around the finger, slowly bring the end of the
finger round inside the cheek, and force it smartly out through the lips.
The result will be a loud pop. By moving the tongue from the back
of the mouth quickly backwards and forwards, making it strike against
the inside of the gums, the &#8220;glug, glug&#8221; of the wine being poured out
will be plainly heard.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lion and the Cow</span></h3>

<p>Under the cover of a screen, the roaring of a lion is simple of
accomplishment. Use an ordinary lamp chimney, and give vent to a
series of deep-throated roars from this. The effect will both be
natural and startling. With the same instrument the deep lowing of
a cow can be perfectly imitated, the lips producing the familiar &#8220;moo,&#8221;
the sound being gradually drawled through the glass chimney.</p>

<p>To copy a saw at work is quite easy. Get a ruler, or some similar
article, to represent the saw, and draw it backwards and forwards as
though cutting a piece of wood. The sound is best made by clenching
the teeth, placing the tongue a little forward between the upper and
lower teeth, quickly inhaling and exhaling the air. The resultant noise
will be an exact imitation of the saw cutting its way through the
wood.</p>

<p>Quite an effective item is the ascent of a rocket. By blowing hard
through pursed lips, and striking the mouth rapidly with sharp little
blows with closed fingers, the curious sound of an ascending rocket
may be reproduced with perfect fidelity. This slowly fades away,
there is a moment&#8217;s pause, and then the final pop as the stars burst.
Naturally such an imitation should be performed in the shelter of
the screen. As a last example, an imitation of the itinerant knife-grinder
may be attempted. Keep the lips and the teeth closed to
produce the rasping up and down of the steel upon the grindstone,
the while working an imaginary treadle with the right foot.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Complete Entertainment</span></h3>

<p>By this time the young ventriloquist should have at his command
both &#8220;near&#8221; and &#8220;distant&#8221; voices and imitations. It only remains to
say a few words regarding the manner of giving an entertainment.</p>

<p>Although smart dialogue is very entertaining, it is apt, after a little
while, to pall; and to obviate this it will be found well to introduce
an occasional song or comic recitation. In both cases these may take
the form of parodies, but in the former a serious song really well sung
by the ventriloquial figure will evoke both admiration and applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span></p>

<p>Those not possessed of particularly good vocal qualifications may
feel that the singing of a song successfully is beyond their capabilities.
They should, however, bear in mind that nothing like &#8220;finish&#8221; or
cleverness in execution is expected from a wooden figure. One or
two verses and the chorus are quite enough to venture upon, as singing
ventriloquially is extremely tiring.</p>

<p>The best time to introduce a song is when dialogue between
yourself and the automata has been in progress for seven or eight
minutes. Either the little boy or the old man or the old woman can
essay to try his or her skill as a vocalist, or the affair may be competitive.
Much amusement may be caused by the little boy extolling
his own skill as a vocalist, and the darky challenging him. To settle
the matter, let one sing the first verse of a song and the other the
second, the little boy making a terrible hash of his part of the performance.
If his mistakes are greeted with groans of derision from
the old man, or cries of horror from the old woman, the audience will
be immensely pleased.</p>

<p>While the song is in progress, the ventriloquist should look about
him unconcernedly, feigning total disinterestedness in the affair.
Towards the end of the song he may glance sharply once or twice at
the singer and applaud him for his effort, which applause it is to be
hoped the audience will generously supplement.</p>

<p>It is not intended that these few observations on the art of ventriloquism
should be taken as covering all the ground over which this
fascinating subject spreads. Enough has been said, however, to show
any one who is sufficiently interested how to give a really pleasing
drawing-room performance which shall earn for him the reputation of
being quite a creditable exponent of the wondrous and mystifying art
of Valentine Vox.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XX</b><br />
CONJURING FOR ALL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Magic Memorized</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that at some period of his life every boy becomes stage-struck,
and it may be averred with equal truth that sooner or later
every boy is seized with a desire to become a conjurer.</p>

<p>Considering the fascination to old and young alike of a conjuring
entertainment, this is not to be wondered at. But when the would-be
conjurer begins to realize the years and years of practice necessary
before he can accomplish his desire,
he soon despairs; and instead
of proudly mounting the platform
as an entertainer, he finally satisfies
himself by humbly occupying a
chair as one of the entertained.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter,
however, to set forth a complete
conjuring entertainment in
such a manner that anybody can
easily learn and perform it, in precisely
the same manner as they
would memorize and deliver a recitation.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the
tricks themselves, it will perhaps
be advisable, for the sake of the
uninitiated, briefly to describe how to fit up a handy conjuring table.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;A handy conjuring table.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Procure a small wooden box about six inches deep and one foot in
length and width, and stand it in the center of a small gypsy-table.
Then artistically drape one or two flags, or a brightly-colored cloth
over it (<a href="#Fig20_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a portion of the table at the back of the
box is left vacant. This, in the dialect of the profession, is known
as the <i>servante</i>. It is used for secretly disposing of objects during the
performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span></p>

<p>The magic wand simply consists of a decorated circular stick about

<p>Each trick will be dealt with in three separate parts. The first
will describe the illusion from the point of view of the audience; the
second will explain the apparatus required; and the third the &#8220;patter&#8221;
accompanying each trick.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i>&mdash;As seen by the audience, the first trick is as follows:</p>

<p>Two ping-pong balls are lying upon the table, and the conjurer
requests a member of the audience to choose one. This having been
done, the performer picks up the selected ball and commences
gently rubbing it in the palms of his hands, when to the amazement
of the audience, the ball is seen to change into a couple of handkerchiefs!</p>

<p>The conjurer places one of these upon the table, and proceeds to
wrap up the other in a piece of pink paper. Blowing out a candle
which has been standing in a candlestick upon the table, the performer
wraps that also into a similar parcel, using white paper instead
of pink.</p>

<p>He next places the two parcels at opposite ends of the table, in
full view of the audience. After making one or two passes with the
magic wand, the conjurer picks up the parcel containing the candle.
He then tears it open, when it is found to contain the handkerchief.
Upon the remaining parcel being examined the candle is discovered
within it.</p>

<p><i>Apparatus required.</i>&mdash;(1) Two ping-pong balls. A large hole must
be bored in one by means of a penknife.</p>

<div class="figleft w150" id="Fig20_2">

<img src="images/illo160.png" alt="" width="150" height="442" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;False candle
containing
handkerchief.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>(2) Three small silk handkerchiefs. Two of these should be stuffed
into the prepared ball through the hole. Both balls must then be
placed upon the conjuring table&mdash;the hole in the prepared one being
turned away from the audience.</p>

<p>(3) An ordinary candle wrapped in a piece of pink paper, and concealed
in readiness on the <i>servante</i>. Another piece of pink paper and
a piece of white should also be ready at hand.</p>

<p>(4) A &#8220;false&#8221; candle. This is made by gumming a piece of white
paper into the form of a cylinder, and sticking a slice from a real
candle in one end. The third handkerchief must be stuffed into the
&#8220;false&#8221; candle (<a href="#Fig20_2">Fig. 2</a>), which should then be placed in a candlestick.
From a short distance it will be impossible to distinguish this
candle from the genuine article, and the effect will be considerably
heightened by the candle-end being lit.</p>

<p><i>Patter.</i>&mdash;The conjurer comes forward to the front of the platform
and delivers himself somewhat after the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;you will observe upon my table two<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
ping-pong or table-tennis balls. They are quite innocent-looking,
and although in appearance they somewhat resemble eggs, will not be
found half so deceptive. Will some lady or gentleman kindly select
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>If the ball containing the handkerchief is selected the conjurer
picks it up and proceeds with the trick. Should the other be chosen,
however, it makes no difference. The entertainer
simply hands it to the person who has made the selection,
and remarks: &#8220;Very well. Would you mind
taking the ball you have chosen and examining it?&#8221;
Upon the person complying with his request, the conjurer
picks up the remaining ball&mdash;the prepared one&mdash;and
continues with the trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he says, slowly rubbing
the ball between the palms of his hands, and carefully
extracting the first handkerchief from its interior (a
simple effort in sleight-of-hand, quickly acquired), &#8220;we
will now see what effect a little friction has. Ah!
Something is happening already!&#8221;</p>

<p>The performer allows the second handkerchief to
stream forth, and then gradually opens his hands,
taking care that one of the handkerchiefs completely
covers the ball and hides it from view. He then
lays the handkerchief sheltering the ball carelessly upon
the table. If this is done in a natural manner, the
audience will not have the slightest suspicion that it
covers anything at all. Holding the remaining handkerchief up to
view, he continues:</p>

<p>&#8220;We will now see whether this inherits any of the marvelous
properties of the ball from which it was produced. I have here a
piece of paper.&#8221; (Holds up the red paper.) &#8220;It contains neither
trap-doors, hidden mirrors, nor other mechanical contrivances. The
reason for my using pink paper is that it insures the trick being performed
to the <i>pink</i> of perfection. I will now proceed to roll up the
handkerchief in the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is done, the performer taking care to make the parcel exactly
similar in shape to that of the candle on the <i>servante</i>. During the
wrapping-up process, however, he carelessly drops the parcel on the
<i>servante</i>. With a muttered excuse for his clumsiness, the conjurer
again resorts to quickness of the hand, and picks up <i>the parcel containing
the candle</i>. The very audacity of this movement will effectually keep
the audience from suspecting that a substitution has been effected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now take this candle and wrap it in the piece of white<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
paper I have here. By the way, can any one tell me what nobleman could
very well be represented by a burnt-out candle? No one? Why, the
Earl of Wicklow!&#8221; (He blows out the &#8220;false&#8221; candle and wraps it in
the white paper.)</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I have now two parcels&mdash;the pink one containing the
handkerchief, the white one containing the candle. I will place them
at opposite ends of the table, and make a few passes with my magic
wand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The performer waves the wand a few times. Then, seizing the
packet containing the &#8220;false&#8221; candle, he rips it open, thus tearing the
paper cylinder, and revealing the handkerchief. The small wax candle-end
will escape observation amongst the torn paper, and the audience
will be under the impression that the candle has changed to a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will a gentleman kindly step forward and examine the remaining
parcel?&#8221; (Upon the examination being made it is found, of course,
to contain the candle.) &#8220;What! The handkerchief and candle
appear to have disagreed with the quarters I originally allotted them,
and have changed places! I think you will agree with me that this
little experiment has terminated in a very interesting manner. I
think you will also agree that I have not once attempted to deceive
you, as the whole of the experiment was conducted before your
very eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second trick might very aptly be entitled</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dye-Works</span></h3>

<p><i>Presentation.</i>&mdash;The conjurer hands round for inspection a small
sheet of white paper. Upon its being returned, he rolls it into a cylinder.
Taking a couple of red silk handkerchiefs from the table, he
proceeds to poke them into the tube by means of the magic wand.
He continues to force them down until they at length make their
appearance at the other end. During this short passage through the
tube, however, an astonishing transformation has ensued. Instead of
the handkerchiefs being red, one emerges a deep blue and the other
yellow! Yet upon the roll of paper being passed round for inspection
it is found to be perfectly empty.</p>

<div class="figright w200" id="Fig20_3">

<img src="images/illo162.png" alt="" width="200" height="389" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Cardboard tube
with silk bag and handkerchief
attached.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Apparatus required.</i>&mdash;(1) Two red, one blue, and a yellow silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p>(2) A sheet of stout white paper about six inches long by five wide.</p>

<p>(3) A small cardboard tube about three inches long and an inch
and a half in diameter. A section cut from an ordinary postal tube
will do admirably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span></p>

<p>A small bag of yellow silk must be sewn by its edges to the
interior of this tube (<a href="#Fig20_3">Fig. 3</a>). The yellow handkerchief should next
be stitched by its center to the bag, as is shown in the same diagram.
This done, both the yellow and blue handkerchiefs must be
forced into the cardboard tube until they are completely hidden.
There will be no difficulty in doing this, as silk can be made to occupy
a very small space. The bag, of course, will
prevent the handkerchiefs coming out at the
other end.</p>

<p>The cardboard tube and its contents should
then be placed upon the table, and the two red
handkerchiefs laid carelessly over it in order to
obscure it from the view of the audience.</p>

<p><i>Patter.</i>&mdash;&#8220;I have here an ordinary sheet of
white paper. I intend, however, to turn it to a
rather extraordinary purpose; in fact, to manufacture
with it a dye-works!</p>

<p>&#8220;I first roll the paper into a cylinder&mdash;so.
Please notice that I do not attempt to insert anything
as I do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The performer rolls up the paper, taking care
to make it sufficiently large to admit the little
cardboard tube.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have also two red silk handkerchiefs.
Every lady present to-night will know how very
difficult it is to dye anything that is red. Nevertheless, I am going to
put these handkerchiefs down my dye-works&#8217; chimney.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picks up the handkerchiefs&mdash;with the tube still hidden in them&mdash;and
apparently attempts to poke them into the cylinder. In reality,
however, he only inserts the cardboard tube, and then pauses, as though
in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ladies and gentlemen, it appears as if I haven&#8217;t built my
dye-works large enough to receive both handkerchiefs together. I think
it will be advisable, therefore, to insert them singly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conjurer proceeds to place first one and then the other
handkerchief in the tube. Then, taking up his magic wand he rams
them well down. This has the effect of forcing them both into
the small cardboard tube, thus liberating the blue and yellow handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I see that one of the handkerchiefs is issuing from
the basement of our dye-works. And the color has been altered during
its journey! Here comes the other straight from the mangle,
and, as you will observe, it is now dyed yellow. The dye-works<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
has proved most successful. In fact, I believe that if I&#8217;d inserted a
third handkerchief it would have come out folded and ironed!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter w370" id="Fig20_4">

<img src="images/illo163a.png" alt="" width="362" height="263" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Handkerchief covering small cardboard tube
drawn from cylinder.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>So saying, the conjurer takes the yellow handkerchief by its
middle and draws
it from the paper
cylinder. The
cardboard tube,
with the red handkerchiefs
safely in
it, will, of course,
be drawn out at
the same time.
The folds of the
yellow handkerchief,
however,
will completely
hide it (<a href="#Fig20_4">Fig. 4</a>).
The conjurer then
throws the paper
cylinder amongst the audience, with the <span class="nowrap">remark&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, ladies and gentlemen. As I am of a philanthropic
nature, I will let you have my dye-works free of charge, with full
permission to make whatever use you
like of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The third trick may be called</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dissolving Coin</span></h3>

<p><i>Presentation.</i>&mdash;The conjurer,
standing a glass of water upon his
table, borrows a quarter, and places
it in the center of a loaned handkerchief.
He then requests a member
of the audience to hold it
over the glass so that the folds of
the handkerchief hang around it
and completely hide it from view
(<a href="#Fig20_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>The performer next asks the person
holding the coin to let it drop
into the water. He does so, and the audience hear it tinkle as it strikes
the bottom of the glass. But when the handkerchief is removed, the
quarter has disappeared!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span></p>

<div class="split4060">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right4060-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

<p>A dish containing a number of oranges is standing upon the table.
The conjurer picks up a knife and plunges it into one. Passing it to
a member of the audience, he requests him to cut it open. Upon this
being done the quarter is discovered embedded in the center of the
fruit (<a href="#Fig20_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p><i>Apparatus required.</i>&mdash;(1) A glass of water. (2) A silver quarter.
(3) A watch-glass the size of a quarter. One can be purchased for
five cents from any watch repairer&#8217;s. (4) A dish of oranges. A small
cut must be made in one of
them, and the quarter forced
into the incision. The prepared
orange should then be
replaced upon the dish, care
being taken that its position
is remembered.</p>

<p><i>Patter.</i>&mdash;&#8220;It is always a
conjurer&#8217;s duty, during some
part of his entertainment, to
borrow. The time is now
ripe for me to perform that
pleasant duty. Will some
one kindly supply me with a quarter and a handkerchief?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the performer walks amongst the audience to obtain the handkerchief,
he secretly takes the watch-glass from his waistcoat pocket&mdash;where
it has been placed in readiness. As he returns to his table with
the handkerchief and the coin, and whilst his back is to the audience,
he must again resort to sleight-of-hand and substitute his watch-glass
for the coin, which can either be slipped into his waistcoat pocket,
or dropped surreptitiously on to the <i>servante</i>. The performer then
faces the audience, holding up the watch-glass instead of the coin in
the center of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have placed the quarter in the handkerchief, and should now
like the assistance of a young gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. Would you mind holding this coin over the
glass and let it fall into the water when I count three? Thank you!
One&mdash;two&mdash;three! You&#8217;re sure you dropped it? Well, will you please
remove the handkerchief, thus taking the quarter from the water.&#8221;
(The watch-glass, being transparent, will be invisible at the bottom
of the glass, and the assistant will immediately declare that the coin
has vanished.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone, you say? That&#8217;s rather awkward for the gentleman
from whom I borrowed it. But perhaps you&#8217;d like to pay him back
yourself? You strongly object? Well, I must see what I can do!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span></p>

<p>The conjurer walks over to the dish of oranges.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to see how this trick is done, ladies and gentlemen, you
must keep one eye upon me, one eye upon that dish of oranges, and
the other upon the gentleman who is assisting me. What&#8217;s that? You
haven&#8217;t three eyes? I think you are mistaken. First there&#8217;s your
right eye; then there&#8217;s your left eye; and your nect(eye)ie makes the
third.&#8221;</p>

<p>The performer then plunges a knife into the prepared orange and
hands it to his assistant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind cutting that in half?&#8221; (Upon doing so the
young gentleman will, of course, find the coin embedded in the fruit.)
&#8220;You have found the missing coin in its center? I consider
it rather clever of me to purchase for a few cents oranges that
grow quarters. Would you mind returning the coin to its owner;
and I must thank you for the very able assistance you have afforded
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next trick may be called</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Watch and Target</span></h3>

<p><i>Presentation.</i>&mdash;The conjurer borrows a watch from a member of
the audience and wraps it in a piece of paper. He next places
it in the muzzle of a
pistol, and then stands
a target upon the
table. Handing the
pistol to a gentleman
in the audience,
the performer requests
him to fire at
the target. There is
a loud report, and&mdash;hey, presto!&mdash;the watch is found swinging in the
center of the target! And upon the paper parcel which contained
the watch being removed from the pistol&#8217;s
muzzle it is found to be perfectly empty.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right6733-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split6733-->

<p><i>Apparatus required.</i>&mdash;(1) A piece of paper
in which to wrap the borrowed watch; and
a second piece of the same size and color.
This must be folded to create the impression
that it contains a watch.</p>

<p>(2) An ordinary toy pistol. This must be taken to a tinsmith, in
order to have a tin muzzle of the shape shown in <a href="#Fig20_7">Fig. 7</a> soldered to
the barrel. It will also be necessary for the tinsmith to make another<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
very important addition to the pistol. It consists of the little pan
illustrated in <a href="#Fig20_8">Fig. 8</a>. This pan fits into the muzzle. But in order
that it may not sink down too far, and can be removed easily, a flange
must be made round the edge, as shown in <a href="#Fig20_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#Fig20_8">8</a>. Before commencing
the trick, the piece of paper folded into the shape of a watch
must be placed inside the muzzle, and the tin pan
fitted into position on top of it.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>(3) A target (<a href="#Fig20_9">Fig. 9</a>). This target, as might
be anticipated, is not so simple as it looks. The
&#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8221; at the center must be cut completely out
with a fretsaw, and then replaced again on the two
pivots (B B, <a href="#Fig20_10">Fig. 10</a>). A small wooden clip should
next be fixed in the position illustrated by C, and
a piece of elastic fastened to the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8221;
at A, and stretched to the
other side of the target.</p>

<p>It will now be observed
that the tendency of
the elastic is to make the
&#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8221; revolve upon
its pivots. The wooden
catch C, however, prevents
this happening.</p>

<p>The catch is secured to the target by a
single nail or screw, in precisely the same
manner as the &#8220;button&#8221; is fixed to an ordinary
cupboard door. A piece of black thread
must be fastened to one end of the catch, and
carried down behind the target through a
series of hooks made from bent pins (D,
<a href="#Fig20_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>A pull at the thread thus causes the
wooden catch to release the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8221; which
will instantly be forced round upon its pivots
by the elastic, and show the other side:&mdash;which
must be similarly painted with rings&mdash;to the
audience. To complete the target, drive a
small hook into the center of the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye.&#8221;
The finished article must then be placed behind
a screen in readiness for the performance.</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig20_11">

<img src="images/illo167.png" alt="" width="300" height="409" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;The elastic at A will be
found invaluable to the young
conjurer.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>(4) Lastly, a small piece of black elastic should be sewn across
the V-shaped opening at the bottom of the conjurer&#8217;s waistcoat, as
shown in <a href="#Fig20_11">Fig. 11</a>. This keeps the bottom of
the waistcoat perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
tight, thus making a handy receptacle for any article the performer
may poke up it out of sight.</p>

<p><i>Patter.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I was so successful in borrowing
for my last trick, that I am encouraged to be a little less
timid in my requests. Will some gentleman kindly lend me his
watch? Thank you, sir! I may muddle up the wheels a bit
during my experiment; but I suppose you don&#8217;t mind that, provided
the watch <i>looks</i> all right when I
return it? Now, sir, would you mind
wrapping your watch up in this piece of
paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whilst the lender of the watch is
engaged in wrapping up his property, the
conjurer walks to the table and returns
with the pistol in his hand. He then
takes the parcel from the gentleman, and
apparently places it in the muzzle. In
reality, however, it is put only into the
small pan.</p>

<p>The performer turns round, and
walks towards his table. Holding the
pistol well into the body so that it is
completely screened from the audience,
he quickly places his right hand over
the muzzle, and grips the flange with
his thumb and little finger. It is then
only the work of a moment to lift the
pan and its contents from the pistol, and poke it under his waistcoat.
As the performer&#8217;s back is to the audience, these rapid movements
escape observation.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the table the conjurer lays down the pistol, faces
the audience, and says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that I&#8217;ve got my ammunition, I suppose I&#8217;d better get
a target.&#8221;</p>

<p>He retires behind the screen sheltering the target. Hastily taking
the pan from his waistcoat, he tears the watch from the paper, and
hangs it upon the hook on the reverse side of the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye.&#8221; Then,
returning to the platform, he places the target upon the table, and
taking up the pistol, says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the gentleman who lent me the watch kindly take this pistol
and fire at the target when I count three?&#8221; (Upon taking the pistol
the gentleman will see the second piece of paper in the muzzle, and
imagine that it contains the watch.) &#8220;Are you ready? One!&mdash;I hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
you are a good shot. Two!&mdash;Mind you don&#8217;t hit me instead of the
target. THREE!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he utters the last word the conjurer pulls the thread, and simultaneous
with the report of the pistol, the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8221; flashes round and
reveals the watch hanging to its center.</p>

<p>Of course the thread must be sufficiently long to permit the performer
to stand a short distance from the target. Against a dark background
the thread will be quite invisible to the audience.</p>

<p>Upon the second parcel being examined it will, of course, be found
quite empty.</p>

SOME KNOTTY POINTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Secrets of Handkerchief Manipulation</span></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The one hand knot.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following explanations are intended to provide the beginner with
the knowledge necessary to perform a few of the simple but neat
tricks which can be done
with no other apparatus
than a handkerchief. For
a short turn or &#8220;gag&#8221;
these tricks are effective and useful, whilst their very simplicity renders
a quick return for the little trouble required
to learn them.</p>

<p>A good-sized silk handkerchief must be
procured. Before making any of the knots
it should be twisted like a rope (<a href="#Fig21_1">Fig. 1</a>). Being
of silk, the handkerchief will not untwine
easily.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The One Hand Knot</span></h3>

<p>This knot is very simple to make. Hold
the handkerchief, bent double, across the right
hand (<a href="#Fig21_2">Fig. 2</a>). Now, suddenly drop the hand,
letting the fingers pass over the end, A, and
catch the end, B, at the point, C, between the
first and second fingers. Let the remainder
of the handkerchief slip off the hand, giving
it a sharp flick, which will tighten the knot
already loosely formed.</p>

<p>Practice constantly until the whole movement
can be done very rapidly. To the
spectators it will appear as if you have suddenly
flicked the handkerchief into a knot, and
the effect will be striking.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Wrist Knot</span></h3>

<p>Stretch the handkerchief between the finger and thumb in both
hands, as in <a href="#Fig21_3">Fig. 3</a>. Cast a loop towards the
left hand, taking care<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
that it is thrown outwards. As the loop is made, the left hand, still
with the end of the handkerchief between finger and thumb, is passed
smartly through the loop from the outside&mdash;shown by the dotted lines
in the illustration.</p>

<p>This loop is now loosely round the left wrist, and the knot can be
made taut by pulling the ends with both hands. The instant it is
drawn tight let go of the ends of the handkerchief, and the result will
be that a simple twitch of the right hand has seemed to tie a knot
firmly round your left wrist.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Double Bow</span></h3>

<p>This very pretty trick can be accomplished by making a double
bow with a rapid turn of the hands.</p>

<p>Hold the twisted handkerchief in both hands, as shown by <a href="#Fig21_4">Fig. 4</a>.
The two hands are marked L and R&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, left and right respectively.
Now bring the right hand round and past the left, as indicated by the
dotted lines, and nip the handkerchief at the point A with the first and
second fingers of the right hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig21_3">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The double bow.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span></p>

<p>By doing this you have naturally brought the point B opposite the
first and second fingers of the left hand, between which it should be
similarly nipped. During all these movements the remaining fingers
and thumbs of each hand should retain their original hold on the
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Having now taken hold of both the points A and B, straighten
your hands and pull apart, still retaining the hold of the first and
second fingers. As a result you will find the handkerchief tied in a
double bow, which, if the movements have been done quickly and
well, will seem to have been accomplished by some strange effect of
magic.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Instantaneous Knots</span></h3>

<p>These knots can be made at each end of the handkerchief by the
following method. Hold the handkerchief in the position shown in
<a href="#Fig21_5">Fig. 5</a>, where it appears lying over the third and fourth fingers with
the two ends, A and B, hanging beyond the thumbs. The movements
are done in the same way and simultaneously with both hands, and
it will therefore suffice to describe the action of your right hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig21_5">

<img src="images/illo171.png" alt="" width="600" height="267" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Instantaneous knots.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Bring the first and second fingers (1 and 2, <a href="#Fig21_5">Fig. 5</a>) over C, catching
hold of the end, A, behind the wrist. This will be easy after a few
attempts, but you must be careful to see that the end A is of fair length,
otherwise the trick will be impossible.</p>

<p>Now bring the end A up through the resulting loop by means of
the two fingers. The consequence will be a knot in the end of the
handkerchief. Your left hand has, meanwhile, been doing the same
thing and with equal rapidity, so that it will appear to the spectators
that, by a sudden flash of the hands, you have formed two tight knots,
one at each end of the silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Flick Knot</span></h3>

<p>Hold the handkerchief stretched between your two hands in the
manner shown in <a href="#Fig21_6">Fig. 6</a>&mdash;that is, inside the first and second, and outside
the third and fourth fingers of each hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig21_6">

<img src="images/illo172a.png" alt="" width="600" height="203" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;A flick knot.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Give the left hand a half turn, as in <a href="#Fig21_7">Fig. 7</a>, thus enabling the first
and second fingers of the right hand to grip the end A, whilst at the
same moment the thumb and third finger of your left hand catch hold
of the end B.</p>

<div class="figcenter w370" id="Fig21_7">

<img src="images/illo172b.png" alt="" width="370" height="235" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Second stage of the flick knot.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Slip free the fingers of the left hand, excepting those holding the
handkerchief, and you will find a loosely made knot. A smart flick of
the right hand will now complete the trick, and if you have done all
this very rapidly none of the movements will have been noticed by the
audience.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Disappearing Knot</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing remarks have dealt entirely with making knots in
the handkerchief. By following the instructions now given you will
be able to make a knot disappear entirely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span></p>

<p>Take two differently colored handkerchiefs&mdash;red and white, for
instance, and cross them, as in <a href="#Fig21_8">Fig. 8</a>. Now make a simple knot
similar to that shown in <a href="#Fig21_9">Fig. 9</a>. By laying D over C and making
another simple knot, as in <a href="#Fig21_10">Fig. 10</a>, the red end will appear on the
left, whilst the white end will be on the right. This is called a
Grannie&#8217;s knot.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;Grannie&#8217;s knot.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is now plain that if you take hold of
each end of the red handkerchief it can be
pulled quite straight and entirely free of the
turns so closely resembling a genuine knot.
Heighten the deception, however, by seizing
the end D and the bulk of the red
handkerchief and pulling them with all
your strength. The knot will now appear
to have been tied most securely.</p>

<p>Take several handkerchiefs and tie
them in the same way, making apparently
a well-fastened rope to be exhibited to
the spectators. Bunch them all together
on a table, and under cover of the folds
pull all the ends free, exhibiting as a
result a number of separate handkerchiefs, not one of which has a
knot of any description.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXII</b><br />
BLACK STAGE MYSTERIES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Wily Worker of Wonders</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best method by which to advocate the &#8220;black stage&#8221; as a means
of entertainment, will perhaps be to describe one of the many illusions
that can be produced with its aid.</p>

<p>The audience first witnesses the performer&mdash;who is generally made
up as a Chinaman&mdash;and a young lady dressed in white, standing in the
center of a small &#8220;black stage,&#8221; as shown in <a href="#Fig22_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig22_1">

<img src="images/illo174.png" alt="" width="600" height="352" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;The floating head.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The performer then throws a white cloth over the lady&#8217;s head.
Without a moment&#8217;s pause he draws it away again, and&mdash;hey, presto!&mdash;the
lady is headless! The Chinaman next takes a larger cloth, and
holds it before the lady in such a manner that she is entirely hidden
from the spectators. A second later, however, he drops the cloth
to the ground. This time the audience is treated to the spectacle
of the head of the lady floating in the air. More wonderful still, the
head can speak, sing, and answer any questions that may be put to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span></p>

<p>After a while the illusionist picks up the cloth, and holding it
before the head, once more cuts off the view of the spectators. Upon
its being drawn away for the third time, nothing whatever is visible&mdash;even
the mysterious head has vanished. But when the cloth is
held up again and withdrawn, the young lady&mdash;in her entirety&mdash;appears,
and after bowing to the audience, walks unconcernedly off
the stage.</p>

<p>Almost every well-known conjurer has stated at one time or another
that the secret of his success may be summed up in the one word&mdash;practice.
But there are very few young ladies who would have either
the courage or the ability to practice being decapitated. The ordeal
might prove a trifle <i>too exciting</i>. However, they may pass through
it without fear if the following method, given in explanation of the
illusion, be adopted.</p>

<p>The interior of the stage must be fitted throughout with black
cloth. The lights in the room are lowered, the only illumination of
any brilliance being a row of candles or lamps, at the side of the stage.
These are equipped with tin reflectors, so that the light, instead of
shining on the stage, is projected into the eyes of the audience. The
effect of this is that, whilst any white object can be seen quite plainly
by the spectators, everything black remains invisible.</p>

<p>When the performer envelops the young lady&#8217;s head in the white
cloth, he at the same moment throws over her a piece of black material
of similar size and shape, attached to it by one corner. When he
removes the white cloth, however, he allows the black cloth to remain,
thus veiling the head and apparently causing it to disappear.</p>

<p>Another and larger piece of black material is similarly hidden in
the folds of the second white cloth. Directly the performer spreads
this before the lady assistant, so that she is hidden from the audience,
she rapidly pulls off her head-veil, and taking the large black sheet,
muffles herself in it up to the neck. Consequently only her head
remains visible. In order to disappear entirely, it is only necessary
for her to replace the head-veil or to pull the larger black cloth up
over her face.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Essential Assistant</span></h3>

<p>It is usual when working illusions of this description to have the
assistance of a third person. This assistant must be dressed completely
in black, with black gloves and a black mask. The latter can
very easily be made from a piece of silk, or any other material that is
slightly elastic. It should be stitched into the form of a cylinder sufficiently
large to pull over the head. Two eyeholes are then cut in the
desired position, and the mask is complete (<a href="#Fig22_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span></p>

<p>Garbed in this somber attire, the assistant is able to move about
the stage quite freely without being seen by the audience, and to
lend powerful but invisible aid in accomplishing many first-class
deceptions. However, this point will be referred to later, and attention
should now be
turned to the construction
of the
&#8220;black stage&#8221; itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig22_2">

<img src="images/illo176a.png" alt="" width="600" height="280" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The finished frame.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><a href="#Fig22_1">Fig. 1</a> illustrates
the appearance of
the finished stage,
and <a href="#Fig22_2">Fig. 2</a> shows the
framework of which
it is constructed.
This framework is
comprised of a number of laths fastened together by the method
shown in <a href="#Fig22_3">Fig. 3</a>. A small metal rod&mdash;a long nail with the head filed
off will suffice&mdash;is driven into each upright lath. This must be
done carefully or the wood will split. Next a hole is bored by means
of a drill or red-hot poker in each of the laths fitting upon these uprights.
By placing the hole in each cross lath over the nail in the
upright lath, as shown in <a href="#Fig22_3">Fig. 3</a>, the framework can easily be put
together or taken to pieces, when it is necessary to convey the stage
from one point to another.</p>

</div><!--right3367-->

</div><!--split3367-->

<p><a href="#Fig22_4">Fig. 4</a> depicts the mode of fixing two laths together lengthwise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
Instead of having one long lath, it considerably facilitates
conveyance if two smaller laths are joined by two thumbscrews
as shown in <a href="#Fig22_4">Fig. 4</a>. A joint of this description is also shown at C,
<a href="#Fig22_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>As can be seen by the diagram, the framework is simply a skeleton
box; but a little way beyond the center another lath should be carried
across at the top (A B, <a href="#Fig22_2">Fig. 2</a>). Two curtains of black cloth must
be obtained and fastened to this lath so that they overlap at the center
(D, <a href="#Fig22_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>It will now be noticed that this curtain divides the stage into two
separate compartments. The first of these is the stage proper, upon
which the illusionist performs his various mysteries. The second compartment
is reserved to provide an exit for the performer and his
assistants, the flap in the curtains acting as a doorway. Some of the
apparatus required for the various illusions may also be kept here during
the performance.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the stage depend entirely, of course, upon the
size of the room in which the entertainment is to be given. The
minimum width, or &#8220;length of frontage,&#8221; should not be less than
ten feet, and the distance from the front of the stage to the beginning
of the partition curtain not less than six feet. The distance from the
partition curtain to the back of the stage is not of great importance.
Provided there is room for the assistant to move about, this is all that
is required. Two and a half feet is ample.</p>

<p>The following dimensions will be found about as convenient as
any; but if the reader is in a position to construct a larger stage, so
much the better.</p>

<p>Frontage, 12 ft.; height, 7 ft. 6 in.; distance from front to partition
curtain, 7 ft. 6 in.; from partition curtain to back of stage, 3 ft.</p>

<p>Having decided upon the measurements of the stage, a further
supply of black cloth must be procured and fitted completely over the
framework. It is preferable to have
this cloth already stitched into shape
(<a href="#Fig22_6">Fig. 6</a>), so that it can be simply
drawn on over the box-like structure
of laths.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig22_6">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Cloth covering for frame.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is also necessary to spread
another piece of black cloth upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Lastly, the stage front must be
decorated. These decorations consist
merely of two curtains hooked at each side of the opening, and a
frieze draped along the top lath, as shown in <a href="#Fig22_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span></p>

<p>The lighting arrangements must be left largely to the discretion of
the reader. If he be a &#8220;handyman,&#8221; he can fit four incandescent gas
burners to the front of the show. A very effective, although primitive,
method of lighting is illustrated by <a href="#Fig22_7">Fig. 7</a>. Two pieces of wire are
hooked to the top lath, a pair at each side, and three small bull&#8217;s-eye
lanterns fastened at intervals to them (see diagram).</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right3367-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split3367-->

<p>Yet another method is depicted in <a href="#Fig22_8">Fig. 8</a>. About half-a-dozen
holes are bored in a piece of gas-piping, which is stopped at one end.
Ordinary burners are screwed into these holes and tin reflectors attached.
The whole arrangement is then bound securely to the top lath after
the framework has been fitted together. It is then necessary only to
fix a length of gas-tubing from the open end of the pipe to the nearest
gas-fitting. If the reader decides upon the latter method of illumination,
his best course will be to go to a plumber and place the job entirely
in his hands.</p>

<p>The chief thing to bear in mind is, that no light must shine into
the stage, the only illumination being projected into the eyes of the
spectators, thus dazzling their vision as much as possible.</p>

<p>The stage described can, of course, be greatly improved upon. The
above description is intended simply as a rough guide for the boy whose
skill in carpentry does not extend much beyond knocking a nail or tin-tack
properly into a piece of wood, which, by the way, is not such an
easy task as most people imagine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span></p>

<p>Having constructed a stage suitable for working purposes, we may
proceed with another illusion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Floating Barrel</span></h3>

<p>The performer, who, as previously stated, should be dressed as a
Chinaman, or in a white costume of some description, stands alone in
full view of his audience. Presently he makes a beckoning motion,
and a large white barrel floats slowly into view. To the amazement
of the spectators, it drops gently to the ground at the magician&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>He then turns to the other side of the stage and repeats the beckoning
motion. Immediately a second barrel makes its appearance, and
deposits itself on the ground a short distance from the first.</p>

<p>Turning to the audience the performer borrows a dozen or so rings,
chains, and other trinkets. Walking back to the stage, he holds the
borrowed trinkets above the mouth of one barrel, and clearly drops
the mass of jewelry into it. The next moment, without a second&#8217;s
pause, the illusionist seizes the barrel and turns it upside down.</p>

<p>Nothing falls out. It is perfectly empty!</p>

<p>Thereupon he darts to the other barrel, turns it over, and out
shower the trinkets.</p>

<p>The performer replaces them, and immediately overturns that barrel
as he did the first. But once again the jewelry is found to have disappeared.
Nor can it be discovered in the other barrel.</p>

<p>Retreating to one side of the stage, however, the illusionist waves
his hands. There is a slight flash, and a small Japanese table is seen
standing in the center of the stage, with the trinkets heaped upon it.</p>

<p>This is a very effective illusion, but it can be even improved upon,
as the reader will see when he has read the following simple explanation
of the trick.</p>

<p>Its success lies almost entirely with the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant previously
referred to. The &#8220;floating&#8221; barrels are simply carried in by this assistant,
who must take care to hold them in such a manner that his black-gloved
hands do not show up against the white wood.</p>

<p>Whilst the performer is collecting the articles of jewelry the assistant
holds a small bag or sack in the mouth of the barrel. Consequently,
when the performer drops the trinkets into the barrel, they in reality
enter the sack, when it is a simple thing for the assistant to transfer
them to the second barrel&mdash;the black bag rendering them invisible during
transit.</p>

<p>Immediately the performer appears to deposit the trinkets in the
barrel for the second time, the assistant again secures them in his small
sack. This time, however, he carries them to the side of the stage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
where a Japanese table has been placed in readiness out of sight of the
audience. This table is draped with black cloth, which, as already
explained, makes it invisible. The assistant merely lifts up this cloth
and empties the trinkets from the sack on to the table. Then, replacing
the cloth, he carries the table and its contents to the middle of the
stage.</p>

<p>Next he simply whisks away the black cloth when the performer
gives the signal, and the table, with its small heap of jewelry, stands
revealed.</p>

<p>As previously stated, this illusion can easily be improved upon.
For instance, the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant can place a live rabbit in one of the
barrels, giving the audience the impression that the jewelry has
undergone a somewhat extraordinary, though unprofitable, transformation.</p>

<p>The performer should attempt to vary the nature of his entertainment
as much as possible, and the following illusion could very well
occupy the next place upon the programme.</p>

<p>In obedience to the performer&#8217;s command, a large white box or
wicker-basket floats on to the stage. This, as the reader will have been
able to gather from the explanation of the previous illusion, is simply
carried on by the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant.</p>

<p>After having shown that the box or basket&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;is
perfectly empty, the illusionist raises it from the stage by placing
four blocks, one under each corner. This is to prove the impossibility
of a &#8220;false bottom&#8221; or trap-door being used.</p>

<p>A man now walks on to the stage, with a white sheet wrapped round
him, and looking like a Dervish or bernoused Arab. Stepping into the
basket, he coils himself up until he is concealed at the bottom.</p>

<p>There is a pause of a few seconds, after which a low groan issues
from the interior of the basket. A moment later the sheet is seen to
shoot up into the air, and collapse in a heap upon the stage. Both
sheet and basket are examined; but their human occupant has disappeared&mdash;has
vanished, as it were, into thin air!</p>

<p>The illusionist next throws the sheet back into the basket. No
sooner has he done this than it is seen mysteriously to raise itself on
end. Then for a second time it collapses. A moment later, however,
a second disturbance is seen to be in progress inside the basket, and
this time the white-robed man rises from it, and steps out upon the
stage.</p>

<p>The secret of this illusion lies in the fact that the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant
and white-robed man are one and the same person.</p>

<p>Directly the assistant has carried the wicker basket in, and whilst
the illusionist is showing the audience that it is perfectly empty, he slips<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
&#8220;behind the scenes,&#8221; and, taking off his black mask and gloves, hastily
arrays himself in the sheet.</p>

<p>In this guise he again makes his appearance, and steps into the
basket. No sooner has he snuggled down at the bottom, however, than
he quickly throws off the sheet and replaces the gloves and mask. Giving
vent to a hollow groan, he flings the sheet into the air. This for a
moment diverts the attention of the spectators, and gives the assistant
time to step from the basket, behind which he remains in readiness to
continue with the second part of the illusion. In his black clothes he
will, of course, be quite unseen.</p>

<p>When the performer puts the sheet back into the basket, the assistant
merely stoops and slowly lifts it up, until he can step back into the basket
under cover of it.</p>

<p>As he allows the sheet to collapse for the second time, he sinks down
with it out of sight. He then again removes his black mask and gloves,
and envelops his body in the sheet.</p>

<p>This done, the hard-worked &#8220;black&#8221; assistant in his Dervish disguise
has simply to step from his place of concealment into full view
of the audience, and the illusion is complete.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Vanishing Man</span></h3>

<p>Another good effect, which would act as an excellent climax to the
entertainment, can be brought about as follows:</p>

<p>The performer makes his appearance carrying a large white shawl.
This he spreads upon the ground. Taking the shawl by its two top
corners, he holds it before him so that he is completely hidden.</p>

<p>Next he commences slowly to wave the shawl to and fro, to advance
to the front, and then to retreat to the back of the stage. As he is
advancing for the second time, however, the shawl is suddenly dropped,
and&mdash;hey, presto!&mdash;there is nothing behind it; the illusionist has gone!</p>

<p>But at the very moment the shawl collapses, a loud shout is heard,
and the illusionist is seen standing to the rear of the audience!</p>

<p>In this illusion, as in the others, the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant plays an
important part. His task is not nearly so difficult, however, as those
he has already been called upon to undertake. In fact, the whole illusion,
although it can be made one of the most effective on the programme, is
the easiest to accomplish.</p>

<p>Directly the illusionist picks up the shawl and holds it before him,
the &#8220;black&#8221; assistant steps up and takes it. Still under cover of the
shawl, the two slowly retreat to the back of the stage until they come
to the opening in the partition-curtain (D, <a href="#Fig22_2">Fig. 2</a>). It is then an easy
matter for the illusionist to slip through the opening and get clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
away. The assistant continues to wave the shawl slowly backwards
and forwards, giving the audience the impression that the original performer
is still behind it.</p>

<p>In the meantime the illusionist has made his way out of the room
by a door in the vicinity of the stage. Thence he hurries to a door
leading to that portion of the room containing the audience. Pushing
this slightly open so that he may obtain a view of the stage, he waits
until he sees the shawl drop, when he unexpectedly and dramatically
makes his presence known.</p>

<p>The assistant being arrayed in black apparel will, of course, remain
invisible.</p>

<p>The only drawback to this illusion is, that it necessitates there being
two doors to the room in which the &#8220;black stage&#8221; is erected. Then
again, although a room may possess the requisite doors, one of them
may be so placed that it is impossible for the performer to reach it
without being first seen by the audience. In such a case, however, the
difficulty may be overcome by an ordinary screen placed from the door
to the back entrance of the stage.</p>

<p>As already observed, these illusions can be easily added to and improved
upon. In fact the &#8220;black stage&#8221; and its &#8220;black&#8221; assistant offer
tremendous scope for a really first-class entertainment, teeming with
bewildering and mystifying illusions.</p>

<p>If the stage is large enough, two assistants may be employed, and
still more complex effects attempted. But having described several
illusions of an entirely different nature, and having explained the principle
upon which all such illusions are worked, it must be left to the
reader to invent other &#8220;black stage&#8221; mysteries with which to entertain
and bewilder his friends.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXIII</b><br />
CONCERNING GHOSTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mirror Frauds</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the Honorable Society of Stage Ghosts were to choose a motto, they
would find few more suitable than the old adage, that &#8220;People who
live in glass houses should not throw stones.&#8221; As the following remarks
will serve to show, their very existence depends upon a sheet of glass,
and if this be cracked or broken, farewell to the apparition and all its
attendant mystery.</p>

<p>If you look out of the window of a lighted room upon a dark night,
you will notice that the pane, instead of being transparent, acts as
a mirror and reflects the room behind you. It is on this principle,
applied to a stage, that the greater number of ghost effects are produced.
Owing to the fact that apparitions are usually seen at night,
a good excuse is found for having the stage darkened, whilst the gloom
serves to conceal several things highly undesirable the audience should
observe.</p>

<p>The ghost effect, as seen by the spectators, is somewhat of the following
description. Any person from the audience is requested to come
upon the stage and seat himself in a chair already provided. He has
scarcely taken his seat when a white figure approaches him, passes in
front, in doing so showing that it is transparent. Kneeling by his side,
it lays a hand&mdash;a ghostly white hand&mdash;upon his arm, and appears to
plead with him in a most touching manner. But the gentleman from
the audience is implacable; he takes no notice whatever of his ghostly
supplicant, appearing utterly unconscious of its presence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the object of the ghost&#8217;s entreaties becomes clear. Fumbling
amongst its white robes it produces a ghostly cigar, again begs
our friend with most urgent entreaties for a match, and finally, disgusted
at his callous indifference, shakes a sepulchral fist at him, throws aside
the cumbersome white shrouds, and appears to the spectators as a very
well-dressed young man in immaculate attire. He is still a ghost, however,
and calmly walks right through the gentleman from the audience,
lights his ghostly cigar with an equally ghostly match, pats his friend
condescendingly upon the head, and vanishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Unseeing and Disbelieving</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Ghost? What ghost? I saw no ghost, but I got very tired sitting
up there all that time without anything happening.&#8221; So says the gentleman
from the audience when he returns to his seat, and it is not until
he has seen it all happen to some one else that he will believe anything
really did occur.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig23_1">

<img src="images/illo184.png" alt="" width="400" height="442" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Arrangement of stage
for ghost-producing.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>He is probably provoked when he finds that the next apparition
takes the form of a fascinating young lady who vainly endeavors to
make the young man who
has taken his place kiss
her. Indeed, such indifference
is astounding, and
all her pretty wiles and
enticements are as wasted
upon him as though he
did not see her. As a
matter of fact he does
not know what pleasant
temptations surround him.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig23_1">Fig. 1</a> the stage is
shown in section, and the
phenomenon is explained.
C, G is the stage, upon
which is a chair, H, occupied
by the gentleman
from the audience, I. A
sheet of plate glass, A, B,
rises from the floor of the
stage to the flies, and extends from one wing to the other. This sheet
of glass is tilted forward at an angle to be determined by circumstances.
Between the footlights, D, and the end of the stage, C, is a
space or well, to be occupied by the original of the ghost, K.</p>

<p>When the curtain is raised, the glass, A, B, is quite invisible to the
spectators owing to its transparency, and the extinguishing of the footlights
at D renders the whole of the stage more or less dark. The
space, D, G, is also invisible to the spectators, to whom the stage appears
to present nothing more exceptional than an ordinary chair.</p>

<p>Mr. I, as he may be called, is brought up from the auditorium,
round by the wings and taken to his chair, whence, looking into the
theater before him, he sees nothing of the plate of glass intervening.</p>

<div class="figright w200" id="Fig23_2">

<img src="images/illo186a.png" alt="" width="200" height="554" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The coffin trick.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Being already dressed in the conventional garb of a ghost, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
actor, K, places himself in the space between D and C, whereupon
strong lights on the walls, D, E, and C, F, are switched on, throwing
their glare upon the actor.</p>

<p>Owing to the principle of reflection mentioned above, the glass, A, B,
having a fairly dark background, becomes a mirror upon which is cast
the reflection of the actor K. Of course, Mr. I in his chair is visible
the whole time, but the spectators see in addition to him the reflection
of K, which naturally appears transparent, and moves about the stage
exactly as K moves in the space D, C.</p>

<p>The position of the chair, H, is already known to K, who is accordingly
able to kneel in his space in such a position that his reflection
appears kneeling to I, to go through the rest of the performance with
perfect ease, and to leave our friend I perfectly ignorant of what has
occurred. Returning for a moment to the example of a pane of glass
in a lighted room, it must be remembered that the spectators are in
the position of the persons within the room and see a reflection of what
is their own side of the glass, whilst I is like a person outdoors who
looks into the room unhindered. To him the stage and the audience
remain the same throughout the whole performance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Paris Illusion</span></h3>

<p>An interesting variation of this scene is produced in Paris at an
old caf&eacute;, known as the &#8220;Cabaret du N&eacute;ant,&#8221; in the Montmartre quarter.
The whole interior of this restaurant is fitted up to appear as funereal
as possible. Guests are served with refreshments upon coffins by waiters
dressed as mourners, whilst the walls are covered with notices and
advertisements of a similarly doleful character.</p>

<p>Upon payment of a small fee the guests are taken into a cellar,
completely dark except for a small glimmer at the farther end. Having
seated themselves they observe this light slowly increase until it is
sufficient to disclose an open coffin standing upright.</p>

<p>Some person from the audience is then requested to accompany
one of the attendants upon the stage, where he is asked to stand upright
in the coffin. His friends and the remainder of the spectators are then
informed in sepulchral tones that they are about to witness a change
which it will some day be the lot of every one to undergo, being at
the same time reassured that the subject of the experiment will suffer
no harm from what is taking place.</p>

<p>A white cloth, stretching from the chin to the heels, is then tucked
round the figure in the coffin, and after a few moments the living face
gradually fades away and a skull is seen in its place, whilst a skeleton
now fills the coffin (<a href="#Fig23_2">Fig. 2</a>). This in its turn
fades away, giving place<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
once more to the original living occupant, who soon descends from the
stage and expresses himself much surprised at what his friends describe,
as he himself has seen nothing of the ghastly change.</p>

<p>As in the former experiment, a large sheet of plate-glass is interposed
between the audience and the rear of the stage
where stands the coffin. This plate of glass is
placed diagonally, as can be seen in the plan,
<a href="#Fig23_3">Fig. 3</a>. The coffin, C, is lighted by several electric
lamps when the man takes his place in full
view of the audience. At D is another coffin in
the wings, invisible to the man at C, as also to
the spectators. When the white cloth has been
wrapped around the living person, the lights are
slowly switched off at C and on at D, with the
result that the skeleton in the latter coffin is reflected
in the glass, A, B, in such a manner that
it appears to be
actually within
the coffin, C. To
bring the man back
to life the operation
is reversed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig23_3">

<img src="images/illo186b.png" alt="" width="400" height="361" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Plan explaining coffin trick.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The object of
wrapping the
white cloth about
the living person
is simply to hide
any difference in size between him and
the skeleton in D. Both coffins have,
of course, been properly arranged to suit the reflections before the
commencement of the experiment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Sea Nymph</span></h3>

<p>The Sea Nymph, shown in <a href="#Fig23_3">Fig. 4</a>, is really a beautiful illusion. The
scenery represents a rolling sea beneath an azure sky, flecked here and
there with skimming clouds. Suddenly from out the waves a graceful
form is seen to appear, and, rising steadily, gambol in the billows.
Circling in the air, she plunges down into the waves, only to reappear
once more, and repeat her charming sport.</p>

<p>The sheet of glass is arranged for this performance as in the case
of the ghost, <a href="#Fig23_1">Fig. 1</a>. The scenery, A, B, <a href="#Fig23_5">Fig. 5</a>, is painted as described,
to represent the sea, and at L and M are placed additional waves, close<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
to the footlights. The
glass, H, K, descends
diagonally. D, E is a
large circular disc revolving
upon an axle, F,
which is connected by a
rope or wire to a barrel
and handle, G. At C and
M strong lights are thrown
upon this disc.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig23_4">

<img src="images/illo187a.png" alt="" width="400" height="460" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The sea nymph.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The young lady who
performs the part of the
nymph is suitably attired,
and takes her place, lying
upon the disc, D, E. At
the proper time the lights
are thrown upon the disc,
with the result that the
spectators see her reflection
in the glass, H, K,
as though she were really
standing upright amongst
the scenery on A, B. By turning the handle at G, the disc is made
to revolve, carrying
with it the recumbent
nymph, who now appears
to be turning
elegant somersaults
amongst the waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig23_5">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Plan explaining sea-nymph illusion.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The only difficulty
about presenting
any of these
effects at home is
the inconvenience of
obtaining and handling
so large a sheet
of plate glass as is
necessary. A good
ghost effect can be
easily produced, however,
in a room with
a large French window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span></p>

<p>The window must be fastened open at an angle that will have to
be ascertained by experiment. The room should then be thrown into
complete darkness. The ghost
takes his place outside the window
and against the wall, D, F (<a href="#Fig23_6">Fig. 6</a>),
with two lamps, B, so arranged as
to cast their light upon him. These
lamps should be shaded in such a
way that they cast no glare except
upon the figure of the ghost.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Plan of room for ghost illusions.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>What happens is very plain.
The open window, G, C, reflects
the shrouded figure of the ghost at
A, making it appear to stand in the
doorway, pointing ominously at
some startled person sitting in the
dark room. It may be added that it is but fair to inform the spectators
of what is about to take place, as many people are alarmed at apparitions,
and have nerves too weak to stand the sudden appearance of a
ghost.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXIV</b><br />
SOME STAGE ILLUSIONS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">For Home Presentation</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> from earliest times wizards and conjurers have attempted
to create illusions to impose upon the more credulous of their dupes,
it was not until the great Robert Houdin devoted his attention to the
matter that any real progress was made in the art. Yet such was
the genius of Houdin that his inventions
have hardly been superseded
in the many years which have
elapsed since his death, whilst in the
greater number of cases his original
plans have barely been improved
upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig24_1">

<img src="images/illo189.png" alt="" width="450" height="290" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;The principle of reflection.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Having dealt with the subject
of stage apparitions in the previous
chapter, it is the intention here to
describe and explain the best illusions
in so simple a manner that, with the minimum of trouble, any
amateur can construct the apparatus necessary for their production.
The successful working of the performance depends entirely upon the
skill of the exhibitors.</p>

<p>A great number of stage illusions are based upon the principle
that a person looking into a mirror from any angle sees the reflection
of objects at a similar angle from the opposite direction. This is
borne out by <a href="#Fig24_1">Fig. 1</a>. Supposing A, B to be the mirror, with the
spectator standing at D, he will see the reflection of an object at E,
the angle D, F, B being equal to the angle E, F, A.</p>

<p>A simple adaptation of this principle is seen in</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Cupboard</span></h3>

<p>This is a large cupboard, of sufficient height to hold a man
comfortably, and about 4 feet wide by 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet deep (<a href="#Fig24_2">Fig. 2</a>). The
doors should be double, and meet at the center post H. The cupboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
can be lined with some simple paper of an unobtrusive pattern,
and the doors should close easily and securely.</p>

<p>Now to describe the performance as it appears to the audience.</p>

<div class="split4060">

<div class="left4060">

<div class="figcenter w220" id="Fig24_2">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right4060-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

<p>The cupboard is opened, and anybody allowed to mount the
stage and see for himself that there is no false bottom or trap in the
floor. When he is perfectly satisfied and has returned to his seat,
the magician introduces his assistant. At a nod from him she enters
the cupboard, which is then closed. The wizard makes a few mystic
passes with his wand, utters the words &#8220;Imshi! Imshi!&#8221; meaning in
Arabic, &#8220;Depart! Depart!&#8221; The cupboard is then opened and&mdash;found
to be empty!</p>

<p>Once more the doors are closed. The magician reverses his
passes, claps his hands, looks upward, and again opens the doors.
The pretty young lady stands inside, smiling radiantly!</p>

<p>The mystery is understandable by a glance at <a href="#Fig24_3">Fig. 3</a>. At E and
F are hinged two mirrors, identical in size with the walls of the
cupboard. When opened inwards these mirrors meet at the post, H,
which serves to conceal the line of their meeting.</p>

<p>Now the whole deception lies in the walls of the cupboard.
When inspected by the audience the two mirrors were flush against
their respective sides, and, having their backs covered with the same
paper used to line the whole interior of the cupboard, they were
mistaken for the real walls against which they were pressed. But
when the mirrors are opened inwards the spectator can see only the
reflection of the actual walls cast upon the mirrors in such a way
that he imagines he sees the back of the cupboard. Of course this is
really hidden from him by the opened mirrors, but they reflect the
paper-lined walls so accurately that a discovery of the deception is
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span></p>

<p>When the lady is introduced into the cupboard the mirrors stand
flat against the sides of the box, which is really empty, but as soon as
the magician closes the outer doors upon his assistant, she pulls out
the sides, shuts herself into the triangle E, H, F, and awaits the opening
of the cupboard. When this takes place the mirrors are, of course, in
the position indicated by <a href="#Fig24_3">Fig. 3</a>. The spectators, seeing in them the
reflection of the walls, think they see the back E, F, and thereby conclude
that the box is empty. This process is reversed when the lady
makes her reappearance.</p>

<div class="figleft w300" id="Fig24_4">

<img src="images/illo191.png" alt="" width="300" height="432" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The Mandarin&#8217;s head.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It need scarcely be said that the object of the wizard&#8217;s passes and
incantations is to give the assistant time to open and close the
mirrors, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when making such a cupboard that the
mirrors shall be flush with the sides at every point, and that when
drawn out they meet at an angle of 45&deg; from the walls. This is
imperative in order that they shall reflect
the actual walls of the cupboard
exactly.</p>

<p>The illusion known as</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Mandarin&#8217;s Head</span></h3>

<p>is arranged upon a principle somewhat
similar to the foregoing.</p>

<p>To the spectators the effect is this.
A box, standing upon a simple card-table,
is opened and seen to contain
a human skull. Remarking that he will
call up the original owner of the skull,
the wizard closes the box, mutters a few
incantations, reopens it, and displays a
living human head as shown in <a href="#Fig24_4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>This head laughs, speaks, and nods,
and in numberless other ways shows
itself to be no mere imitation. The
box having been closed again, the incantations are reversed, and on
the casket being opened once more the skull is found inside as at
first.</p>

<p>The secret of this remarkable illusion requires but little explanation.
In the first place, the table has a hole in its top sufficiently
large to allow of the passage of a human head. The hole is closed by
a trap from below, after the manner shown in <a href="#Fig24_5">Fig. 5</a>, which may be
described in detail thus: A, B, C, D is the table, and E the lid filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
the circular hole. This lid is hinged by G to the table, whilst a bolt,
F,  running through the loops I, I in the table and H, H in the lid,
secures the latter in its place. Upon drawing this bolt the lid opens
downwards.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the simple card-table is not so innocent as it
looks. Indeed, the spectators do not really see under the table at all.
The surrounding screen is reflected in a couple of mirrors shown in
<a href="#Fig24_6">Fig. 6</a>. Let A, B, C, D be the four legs of the table, and A, E, D, E
two mirrors placed in the form of a V between them, and reaching
from the table top to the floor.</p>

<p>The result of this arrangement is that the two front legs, B, C, are
reflected in the mirrors in such a way as to appear to the spectators to
be the back legs, A, D, whilst, as in the former experiment, the reflections
of the walls G, H, F, K, appear to be the actual back F, G, of
the screen.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>When the magician first opens the box the lid of the table is
closed, and a skull, imitation or otherwise, rests upon it. But no
sooner does he close the box than the lid is let down by a confederate,
concealed in the space A, E, D, and the skull removed by
him.</p>

<p>This confederate, who has already been properly prepared, protrudes
his face through the hole, and, when the box is opened, acts his
part to life. When the box is closed he removes his head from the
hole in the table, replaces the skull on the lid, and the trick is done!</p>

<p>The arrangement of mirrors has all along concealed his body,
whilst, as already explained, the audience has been deceived into
thinking they can see beneath the table.</p>

<p>The wizard must take great care to make all his approaches to<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
the table directly from the front, as, should the reflection of his legs
appear in the mirrors, the &#8220;game would be all up.&#8221;</p>

<p>An illusion known as</p>

<h3>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Head of Mary Queen of Scots</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p class="noindent">is worked almost in the same manner.</p>

<p>The effect of the trick is shown in <a href="#Fig24_7">Fig. 7</a>, where the head of the
unfortunate Queen is seen resting upon the hafts of two axes laid
over the arms of a chair.</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>It need scarcely be said that the whole trick lies in the construction
of the chair, illustrated by <a href="#Fig24_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#Fig24_8">8</a>. The peculiarity
about the chair is that the back only reaches down to the spot where
the arms join it, thus leaving a space behind the seat. This space
is concealed from view by a slanting mirror, the bottom of which
rests on the seat, whilst the top comes between the arms of the chair.
This mirror must incline at an angle of 45&deg; from the seat.</p>

<p>The haft of one of the axes laid across the chair arms serves
to conceal the upper edge of the mirror, so that when a head is
thrust upwards, it has the appearance of resting upon the ax handle.</p>

<p>In the curtain against which the chair is placed there must be
a hole exactly corresponding to the empty space in the back of the
chair.</p>

<p>Now, through this hole a girl, whose face and hair have already
been made up to look like that of the murdered Queen of Scots, thrusts
her body just far enough to allow the head to appear above the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
of the mirror. Owing to the angle at which it is placed the mirror
reflects the seat of the chair in such a way that it appears to be
the missing portion of the back. The spectators see nothing of the
girl&#8217;s body; all that is presented to their horrified gaze is the trunkless
head of the beautiful but unfortunate Queen.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">When Three are a Crowd</span></h3>

<p>Most people know the old saying, &#8220;Two are company, three are a
crowd,&#8221; and a glance at the <a href="#Fig24_9">illustration</a> shows
this may really be true.</p>

<p>If three persons stand in a prism-shaped
arrangement of mirrors, as indicated in plan in
<a href="#Fig24_9">Fig. 9</a>, an innumerable series of reflections would
appear and the three would in reality become a
crowd.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Floating Lady</span></h3>

<p>A most interesting illusion is that of The Floating Lady, which,
perhaps, should first be described from the point of view of the
audience.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig24_10">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;The floating lady.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The magician appears upon the stage leading by the hand a fairy-like
lady. Introducing her to the spectators as Mademoiselle Volatile,
he describes her susceptibility to his powers of mesmerism, in proof of
which he offers to keep her suspended in the air for any length of time.</p>

<p>Mlle. Volatile accordingly lies upon a board supported by two
trestles or chairs of the same height. Next the wizard walks round
her, carefully disposing of her drapery and tucking it neatly about her
feet. He makes a few mesmeric passes, examines her pulse carefully,
and removes the trestles. The lady is seen suspended in the air as
in <a href="#Fig24_10">Fig. 10</a>. After a short time the magician reverses his passes, and
smilingly helps Mademoiselle to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span></p>

<p>All this is very mysterious until <a href="#Fig24_11">Fig. 11</a> &#8220;gives the show away.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig24_11">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Key to floating lady
illusion.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A, B represents the back of the scenery through which a hole, E, is
bored. This hole is concealed by a little drapery on the face of the
curtain. Behind the scenes is a simple contrivance, the principle of
which can be seen from the cut. It consists of a strong upright F,
which branches into two arms, each of which terminates in a journal,
H, H. Through these journals runs an iron
bar, D, which, terminating at one end in the
handle, G, has the other end protruding
through the hole in the scenery.</p>

<p>In the board, C, upon which the lady lies,
is a socket to receive the end of the handle.</p>

<p>Now, whilst the lady is putting herself in
position on the board, the magician can walk
right round her, for the bar has not yet been
protruded through the scenery. But, at a
signal from him, an assistant behind the
curtain seizes the handle, G, thrusts the bar
through the hole as far as it will go, and
holds the handle firmly.</p>

<p>Whilst adjusting the lady&#8217;s robe the
magician fits his end of the bar into the
socket in the board, and, still arranging
the folds of her drapery, carefully conceals any sign of what he has
done. Having ascertained that everything is safe, he removes the
trestles, and the board, with its living burden, is maintained in the
air by the iron bar.</p>

<p>After replacing the supports the bolt is withdrawn by the assistant
behind the scenes, and no one suspects the existence of the very
material support which has kept the lady in the air.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Houdin&#8217;s Mesmerism</span></h3>

<p>Robert Houdin used to exhibit to large audiences with startling
success the following example of his mesmeric powers. For the sake
of clearness, let it be supposed that the magician and Mademoiselle
Volatile are performing the trick.</p>

<p>After the usual remarks as to his powers of mesmerism, and how
they set at nought the laws of gravitation, the magician introduces the
fair lady, who wears a short skirt for the occasion.</p>

<p>Taking two sticks, each about five feet long, the wizard requests
Mademoiselle to step upon a stool. Placing one of the sticks beneath
each arm-pit, he then begins the incantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span></p>

<p>When the mystic words have been pronounced and the correct
passes made, the magician removes the stool,
and Mlle. Volatile appears suspended between
the two sticks. One or two more passes are
made and then the wizard removes the stick
from beneath her left arm, <a href="#Fig24_12">Fig. 12</a>, slowly
raising her body to a horizontal position, as
in <a href="#Fig24_13">Fig. 13</a>, and passing a hoop around her
to show there is no hidden support from
behind.</p>

<p>Having left the lady thus suspended for
some time, he lowers her to the perpendicular
once more, replacing the stick under her left
arm and putting the stool beneath her feet.
She is then awakened from the trance.</p>

<p>The stick beneath Mademoiselle&#8217;s right arm
is of special construction, having a core of iron
extending its entire length. The lower end
fits firmly into a socket in the floor, whilst the
upper end itself contains a socket the use of
which is explained later.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Beneath the lady&#8217;s clothing, in fact next her skin, is a well-padded
iron cage, shown in <a href="#Fig24_14">Fig. 14</a>. This cage consists of an iron band,<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
H, G, F, which passes round the body beneath the arm-pits of the
wearer. It is straight behind and somewhat V-shaped in front. A
strong leather strap, E, is fastened to the band
at I, passing between the legs and up the
back, where it is fastened to the band again
at G. Another piece of iron stretches from
H by the side of the body to a point above
the right knee, where it terminates in a loop
of sufficient size to encircle the leg. Every
part of this cage must be well covered to avoid
any discomfort to the wearer.</p>

<p>At H (<a href="#Fig24_15">Fig. 15</a>) is a small bar hinging at
B to a piece of iron, A, which, in its turn,
fits into the socket already mentioned in the
prepared stick. This hinge, B, contains several
notches, X, X, X, the
use of which is now
explained. The bolt
G, is fastened to
the leg-piece D, and
catches the notches
X, X, X at the other end.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that when Mlle. is in
her cage with the bolt C in the lowest notch
X, she will be maintained perfectly securely in
a perpendicular position. When the wizard lifts her horizontally, he
releases the bolt and moves the cage with its occupant upon the hinge
B. Having placed her in position, he shoots the bolt into the top
notch, where it holds the cage firmly.</p>

<p>The whole cage, being beneath her costume, is quite invisible to
the audience, and as soon as the experiment is completed Mlle. runs
off the stage and divests herself of this somewhat uncomfortable
arrangement.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Indian Basket</span></h3>

<p>This familiar deception is yet sufficiently thrilling to prove fascinating
to the most blas&eacute; of spectators. With a little practice it can
easily be worked at home, and the following hints will explain the
performance.</p>

<p>The magician, dressed as Bluebeard, leads Fatima on the stage,
and, during the course of a short conversation, discovers that she has
been prying into matters which had better have been left alone. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
fit of passion he draws his sword and rushes upon her, whereupon
Fatima falls to her knees, crying for mercy. Bluebeard is obdurate,
but after many tears from his wife he consents that she shall be
blindfolded, to prevent her being a witness of her own fate. He binds
a black scarf across her eyes, but has barely finished, when she breaks
away, and rushes from the stage.</p>

<p>Bluebeard pursues hotly, and in another moment returns dragging
the blindfolded girl after him. He puts her into a wicker basket,
fastens the lid, and with a savage grin, thrusts his sword through and
through the basket, his victim shrieking at every stroke.</p>

<p>Having worked the spectators to a pitch of agonized excitement,
the murderer throws down his sword, unfastens the lid of the basket,
and stoops to gaze on his sanguinary work.</p>

<p>The basket is empty!</p>

<p>Staggering back with a look of horror, he suddenly perceives the
&#8220;slaughtered&#8221; Fatima herself appearing from amongst the spectators,
pointing at him accusingly!</p>

<p>The deception in the trick is twofold. Firstly, the basket is of
special construction, and secondly, there are two Fatimas.</p>

<p>With regard to the basket the solution is shown in <a href="#Fig24_16">Figs. 16</a> and <a href="#Fig24_17">17</a>.
The first illustrates the appearance of the basket when Fatima is
thrust inside.</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The lid, A, B, is plain, and hinged to the top at C, D. The back,
E, G, F, J, is similarly hinged at G, J. The top, E, C, F, D, is double,
having a duplicate, L, K, hinged at E, F.</p>

<p>Having placed Fatima in the basket, Bluebeard thrusts his sword
through and through the wicker-work, carefully avoiding the spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
where, as he knows, the girl is lying. At each stroke she screams
lustily, as though the blade were piercing her body.</p>

<p>Then, deftly pushing down the back of the basket, E, G, F, J
(<a href="#Fig24_17">Fig. 17</a>), she rolls herself out upon it, drawing after her the false top,
E, K, by doing which the original back is entirely replaced. She is
now lying outside the basket, which is, of course, empty when opened
by Bluebeard.</p>

<p>Now comes the question of the two Fatimas. The girl who is put
into the basket is not the one who was blindfolded by Bluebeard.
When Fatima rushed away pursued by her murderer her place was
taken by another girl waiting behind the scenes similarly dressed and
of the same height and figure. The bandage upon her eyes hid from
the spectators any difference in features.</p>

<p>The substitute having been apparently slain by Bluebeard, the
original Fatima slipped in at the back of the auditorium, slowly
walked down amongst the spectators (who recognized her face) and
confronted the assassin. In the confusion that naturally followed, the
substitute managed to leave her place behind the basket and vanish
from the stage.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Disappearing Princess</span></h3>

<p>This is an illusion originally produced at one of the French ballets.</p>

<p>A train of slaves appears, bearing a palanquin, in which reclines a
dazzlingly beautiful Princess. The slaves march slowly round the
stage, allowing the spectators ample opportunity to inspect the
palanquin from all sides.</p>

<p>Suddenly a band of brigands rushes upon the scene, with the
obvious intention of seizing the lovely Princess. Flourishing their
glittering swords and brandishing all manner of fearsome weapons,
they surround the palanquin and its terrified bearers.</p>

<p>The robber chieftain advances with uncouth flattery, assuring the
lady that not a hair of her head shall be touched. But the only
answer she makes is to lower in his face the curtain of the litter.</p>

<p>Furious at such an insult, the robber stretches out his hand, and
with a single touch causes the curtains to fly open.</p>

<p>The Princess has disappeared!</p>

<p>Gazing at one another in astonishment, the villains search for the
vanished lady, but their endeavors proving fruitless, they eventually
decide to butcher the slaves and carry off the palanquin as booty.</p>

<p>At this moment a handsome young Prince springs into view; the
robbers, startled at his sudden appearance, take to flight, and abandon
all thought of their prey.</p>

<p>In his turn the Prince approaches the palanquin, sees it empty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
questions the slaves, who can only say that their mistress was there,
but has disappeared. Pulling the curtains aside to see if they offer a
solution to the mystery, he releases them almost instantly, and the
lovely Princess is found reclining upon the litter, smiling so charmingly
that the Prince then and there loses his heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig24_18">

<img src="images/illo200.png" alt="" width="600" height="372" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;The disappearing Princess.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The explanation of all this is very simple. In <a href="#Fig24_18">Fig. 18</a> the lady
is sitting upon what appears to be the bottom of the palanquin. In
reality it is a false floor placed upon the real one. At each corner
are attached cords that run up the four columns and are counterpoised
by heavy weights.</p>

<p>When drawing the curtains, the Princess releases a catch, whereupon
the counterpoise and cords immediately draw her, together with the
false floor upon which she rests, to the roof of the palanquin, which
has been so painted as to make it appear shallower than it really is.
By pressing another spring she is enabled to lower herself once more,
in time to appear before the fortunate and admiring Prince.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXV</b><br />
THE ROOM OF MYSTERY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Make a Haunted House</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> winter evening three boys&mdash;Jim Thompson, his cousin Will
White, and a friend named Handley&mdash;approached the door of Bobbie
Cargill&#8217;s house. Bobbie was a genius for inventions, and they all felt
a desire to see his home.</p>

<p>As they reached the door, White, who was a cynic in his own
way, raised his hand to the knocker and was about to give a thundering
&#8220;rat-tat,&#8221; when the door silently opened, revealing an empty hall
in which the light flickered dimly.</p>

<p>After a glance of surprise at one another the guests entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Close the door! Wipe your boots, and come upstairs!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitors started violently as these words were uttered by a
hollow voice, coming from nowhere in particular, and yet quite close
to where they were standing.</p>

<p>After a moment Handley said in a whisper, &#8220;I don&#8217;t much like
this. It seems&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hang up your hats, and be quick about it</span>,&#8221; the ghostly voice
interrupted sharply. &#8220;<span class="smcap">Are you going to stand chattering there
the whole night? Hang up your hats, I say!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not a pleasant beginning, yet none of the guests cared to
show the white feather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said White. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see it through&#8221;; and setting
an example he placed his hat upon the nearest peg.</p>

<p>Crash! Amidst a clatter as of broken glass the hat and peg
fell to the ground. The three boys looked at one another in consternation!</p>

<p>But before they had time to remark on this misfortune, a shriek
of weird laughter rang in their ears. &#8220;<span class="smcap">Ha! Ha! Ha!</span>&#8221; The
invisible person seemed in paroxysms of mirth at their disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for this a bit,&#8221; muttered Handley; &#8220;let&#8217;s clear out.&#8221;
They were all about to beat a hasty retreat when Bobbie Cargill
appeared, apparently much surprised at finding his visitors making an
awkward group in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;How did you fellows get in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and what have you been
doing? Has there been an accident? Never mind, come along
upstairs and have a &#8216;feed&#8217;; perhaps you will feel better then!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the three guests followed their host to his own
room, which usually went by the name of &#8220;The Den.&#8221; The upper
part of the house was totally dark, and it was with a feeling of relief
that they saw a glimmer of light beneath the door of &#8220;The Den.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Step inside and make yourselves at home,&#8221; said Cargill. &#8220;I will
just run and say that you have arrived,&#8221; and he disappeared into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Followed by the others, White turned the handle and threw the
door open, glad to find a light once more. But the pleasure was
short-lived, for the door had scarcely opened half-way when the light
went out.</p>

<p>White, however, strode into the room, and his friends were about
to follow, when there was a heavy stumble, a crash, and a smothered
shout that was instantly drowned in the violent clatter and ringing of
bells about their very ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; gasped Handley, scarcely able to hear
his own voice in the deafening clamor. Advancing into the darkness,
a violent report beneath his feet caused him to leap into the air with
alarm, whilst in the gloom White was trying to make himself heard
above the pandemonium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Cargill, get a light for goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; howled Handley,
as their host appeared. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what on earth has happened;
it seemed like a pistol going off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows are making a fine noise between you,&#8221; shouted
Cargill. &#8220;Get inside, Jim, and turn on the light; it&#8217;s just to the left.&#8221;
Jim had no sooner stepped across the threshold and begun searching
for the switch, than <span class="allcaps smcap">BANG</span>!
<span class="allcaps smcap">BANG</span>!&mdash;the very floor seemed thundering
beneath him, whilst a rattle as of a thousand pots falling to the
ground made the confusion worse. Leaping back hastily, he collided
with Handley, and the couple sat down with a ponderous thud.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; make yourselves comfortable!&#8221; laughed Bobbie
Cargill. As he spoke the light was turned on, the jangling bells
ceased, and the three guests were discovered gazing ruefully at one
another, whilst their host, calm and collected, smiled down on them
from the doorway.</p>

<p>It was some time before Bobbie could pacify his guests. Indeed,
the situation might have become painfully awkward had they not
happened to glance at the table, which certainly looked inviting.
Knives and forks glistened cheerfully on a spotless white cloth, whilst
dainty mats and sparkling cruets promised a really substantial &#8220;feed.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
A large center-piece full of flowers added to the appearance of the
table, and showed that Bobbie Cargill knew how to do things &#8220;in
style.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following their host&#8217;s example, the three chums took their seats at
the table and glanced round the room. It was a cozy &#8220;Den,&#8221; and
looked cheerful, with a sparkling fire on the hearth. A thick curtain
was drawn across the window at Cargill&#8217;s back, lending an air of
comfort to the place.</p>

<p>Before each guest was a napkin, neatly mitered, with a piece of
bread reposing between the horns, and scarcely noticing what he was
doing, White drew this piece of bread from its resting-place.</p>

<p>A sharp exclamation drew attention to him. There he sat, a mass
of bread-crumbs before him, and a look of surprise on his face!</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had an accident?&#8221; grinned Cargill. &#8220;Never mind
the crumbs, they can soon be scooped up; wait a minute until I
fetch the tray.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had scarcely risen when a roar of laughter burst from Jim
and Handley. By some strange means the entire mass of crumbs had
been swept off the cloth and scattered all over the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have waited for me to clear them away,&#8221; grumbled
Bobbie, and this was the beginning of a heated discussion, which
would probably have ended violently had not the host turned the
conversation by asking Jim if he would take a piece of tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; answered Jim.</p>

<p>Sharpening his knife in a business-like manner, Cargill made ready
to cut a slice.</p>

<p>But at this point a strange thing happened. As soon as the knife
and fork got near the tongue, it leaped from the dish and clung
tenderly to the knife. For a moment or two it hung suspended, and
then flopped back into the dish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have another try,&#8221; said Cargill in a puzzled way. Up
it jumped once more, apparently too anxious to be carved to remain
still on the plate.</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise escaped the guests as all eyes were fixed
upon this strange behavior. Once more the carver thrust his knife
near the tongue, caught it neatly as it ascended, and carried it away to
a side table, where he was obliged to bury his face in a handkerchief,
presumably overcome with grief.</p>

<p>Having recovered somewhat, the host resumed his seat, remarking,
&#8220;I think that tongue is best out of the way. I am afraid I have
nothing better to offer you than some potatoes. You might help them
round, Handley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before his friend had time to reply, the lid of the tureen arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
slowly and deliberately&mdash;ascended and then remained stationary in the
air. Only for a moment, however. Suddenly rising yet higher it
was followed by each individual potato, as one by one they rose
sedately to the ceiling, leaving but one of their number in the tureen.</p>

<p>Their eyes fairly bulging with surprise, the boys looked at one
another, at their host, and then at the tureen with its solitary occupant.
But this last potato had suddenly awakened to a sense of its loneliness,
and sprang into the air to join its companions. Next the whole party
of vegetables slowly crossed the ceiling and disappeared behind the
curtain, to be seen no more.</p>

<p>Jim wanted to jump up and see where they had gone, but his host
dissuaded him, and, anxious to change the subject, asked what he
would have to drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know. What is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>A wine bottle that had been quietly standing in front of White
lurched suddenly forward, as though in answer to the question. At
the same moment the table began to heave, the glasses to rattle, and a
little stool, covered with books, toppled over with a prodigious crash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you some other room we can go to?&#8221; stammered Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, it is only some silly trick of Cargill,&#8221; said White.
Nevertheless all three guests wished themselves well out of it, especially
when the dim light suddenly grew dimmer, and the shadows in
the room increased. In a few seconds the boys were barely able to
see one another.</p>

<p>At this point a mournful moan rang through the room, the curtains
were seen to open, and a white figure glided from between them and
passed out through the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of here, the place is haunted!&#8221; cried White, rising
from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ha! Ha! Ha!</span>&#8221; a ghostly laugh issued from the flowers in the
center of the table, and was echoed by the clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ha! Ha! Ha!</span>&#8221;&mdash;but the guests could stand it no more, and,
scrambling and struggling, they rushed downstairs, with White at their
head. Panting and scared they did not stop until the hall was reached,
when they stood still, staring at one another in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; a sweet voice greeted them. The whole
party turned to find Cargill&#8217;s sister standing at the dining-room
door, looking from one to the other in frank amazement. None of
them cared to reply. It is no pleasant thing to tell a pretty girl that
you have been afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ghost, Dolly,&#8221; gasped her brother after a moment, and in a
shaky voice he recounted their mysterious adventures.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the silly old ghost would not let you have any tea! You<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
must all come in here and enjoy yourselves. I believe there is
plenty to eat,&#8221; and leading the way Miss Dolly ushered them into the
dining-room, where the table was laid with enough good things to
cheer a king.</p>

<p>But when she had shown each of the four friends his seat there
still remained a vacant place at the head of the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; she said with a naughty smile, &#8220;as you are all
feeling much braver now, I am sure you will not mind if the Ghost
sits down and has something to eat, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another and then at her, but Miss Dolly,
taking no notice of their surprise, quietly seated herself in the vacant
chair, passed a plate to White, and <span class="nowrap">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. White, please give the Ghost something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had all had a good tea, of course Bobbie Cargill and his
sister, the Ghost, had to tell the others how it was done. This is the
gist of what they <span class="nowrap">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig25_1">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Apparatus for producing
ghostly sounds.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The opening of the door was a very simple matter. A loop was
tied in one end of a long piece of strong cord or string, which was
carried across to the wall by means of staples, to a concealed corner.
The loop was slipped over the door-catch,
so that when the other end was pulled this
catch was drawn back, whilst the continued
pull on the string made the door open. This
loop was made of such a size, that as soon
as the door had opened to its full extent the
string slipped automatically from the catch,
and could then be pulled away and out of
sight.</p>

<div class="figright w190" id="Fig25_2">

<img src="images/illo206a.png" alt="" width="175" height="502" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Mysterious
hat-stand.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>In the angle formed by the wainscoting
and the floor a piece of simple tubing was
placed, one end reaching a room on the
ground floor, whilst the other was carried
up behind the hat-stand to the height of
about five feet. To this end a cardboard
funnel was fixed, as in <a href="#Fig25_1">Fig. 1</a>, which, sticking
out from the wall, was concealed by a hat or scarf upon the rack.
A similar funnel was placed upon the other end, so that the voice of
any person speaking through the tube from the room was carried
with undiminished force to the hall, thus transmitting the ghostly
messages and weird laughter to the guests.</p>

<p>In most hat-stands the pegs are screwed to the back, and taking
advantage of this, Bobbie Cargill had unscrewed those pegs most likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
to be used by his visitors, putting &#8220;fakes&#8221; in their place. To all appearances
there was no difference between the &#8220;fakes&#8221; and
the proper pegs, but in reality the former were simply
gummed against the rack, just strong enough to bear
their own weight, but too weak to support a hat.</p>

<div class="figleft w110" id="Fig25_3">

<img src="images/illo206b.png" alt="" width="100" height="293" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Prepared hat-stand
peg.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>By the contrivance of a piece of string the fall of
the hat-peg was made to work a kind of booby trap,
explained by <a href="#Fig25_2">Fig. 2</a>, which shows the hat-stand in
section. The false peg, A, is lightly gummed to the
stand, B, C, against the hole D, where the real peg
is screwed. A bent pin or nail is driven into this
end of the peg, as seen in <a href="#Fig25_3">Fig. 3</a>, the end bending
downwards. A thin piece of string, F in <a href="#Fig25_2">Fig. 2</a>, is
fastened round this pin with a loop, passed through
the hole D, and supports at the other end a tin, G,
filled with bits of broken glass, marbles, and such like.</p>

<p>Naturally, when White hung his hat on the peg
the strain brought the peg away from the stand, in its
fall releasing the string and causing the tin to clatter
to the floor. So simply was the whole thing arranged,
however, that Bobbie Cargill had fixed it up in less
time than it has taken to describe.</p>

<p>The absence of lights in the house served a twofold
purpose. In the first place, it made the mystery
and eeriness more marked, whilst at the same time
it concealed several little matters which had to be
hidden in order to insure success.</p>

<p>It will now be necessary to glance at the arrangement of the &#8220;Den,&#8221;
shown by <a href="#Fig25_4">Fig. 4</a>. The room was entered by the door A, whilst in<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
the opposite wall is the fireplace B. The window C is hidden by
the two heavy curtains at D and E. In the center of the room
stood the table F, around which were placed the chairs G, G, G, G.
Between the curtains and the window stood the ghost, who after all
turned out to be none other than Dolly.</p>

<p>Over the center of the table hung the gas, which, being incandescent,
naturally had a burner with a by-pass, and was easily manipulated
by means of a piece of string running up the chandelier,
carried across the ceiling where it was painted white, and down to
Miss Dolly behind the curtains. A weight should be fastened to the
switch to make it fall when not pulled by the string, as in <a href="#Fig25_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Plan of the room of mystery.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>When White opened the door the young lady lowered the gas by
means of her string, and as it was a by-pass the light did not actually
go out, although it went sufficiently low to plunge the room in
darkness.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>It was an easy matter to cause a collision between the visitors.
A piece of cord stretched across the room, at L, L, quickly did its
work, and was then pulled away behind the curtain.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Den&#8221; had not been fitted up so neatly for beauty alone, and
if they had looked, the guests might have found a couple of strong
electric bells concealed beneath the dainty hangings of a picture by
the door. Dolly had but to push a button and these two bells were
set ringing like an alarm clock, and with a persistence calculated to
arouse the Seven Sleepers.</p>

<p>Handley&#8217;s experience required even less preparation. Several
good percussion caps were placed beneath the carpet and covered
with a piece of tin as shown in <a href="#Fig25_6">Fig. 6</a>. In the center of this piece of
tin, a hole was pierced with a nail, making ragged edges on the further
side. These ragged edges were placed over the powder in the cap,
with the result that so soon as Handley trod upon the carpet over the
plate the cap was exploded with a loud report.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bobbie Cargill, arriving under cover of the darkness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
added to the uproar by banging a tin can with a heavy stick, and
performed this office so lustily that nothing else could be heard.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remark that sending Jim into the room
to turn on the switch was merely a feint to get him out of the way,
and to plunge him into the fracas.</p>

<p>A signal from Bobbie was enough to make his sister turn on the
light and release the bell pushes, so that when silence was restored,
and the darkness dispelled, there was nothing to show how all the
commotion had occurred.</p>

<p>By adjusting a screw in the gas-burner Bobbie had previously
arranged matters so that even when the gas was turned full on the
light was not very strong. Although sufficient to illumine the room, it
was feeble enough to hide several tell-tale features.</p>

<p>Besides being an ornament to the table, the large center-piece of
flowers served to conceal the end of a piece of tubing which passed
beneath Bobbie&#8217;s chair to the far side of the curtain. Amongst the
frilled mats, too, there were one or two other contrivances to be
explained in their turn.</p>

<p>It had been Miss Dolly&#8217;s business to make the fake pieces of bread.
Taking a piece of bread and breaking it up into very small crumbs,
she had then added just enough milk to enable her to mold the
crumbs into the shape of a piece of bread again, and had then let the
concoction dry, when it had become sufficiently brittle to suit her
purpose.</p>

<p>Concealed by the mat in the center was a small indiarubber tube,
one end pointed directly to the spot where White had dropped his
mass of crumbs, whilst the other ended in a bulb conveniently placed
to Bobbie&#8217;s hand. He had nothing to do, therefore, but to press the
bulb suddenly, and laugh as the wind thus caused sent the crumbs
flying.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Deceitful Member</span></h3>

<p>The tongue is proverbially a deceitful member, and the one lying
before Bobbie Cargill was no exception to the rule. Indeed, except for
its appearance there was really very little tongue about it. It consisted
of a round tin, in which had been placed a small bar of highly magnetized
iron. By fixing a slice of real tongue to the top of the tin, and
disguising the sides in a similar manner, Bobbie had made such a good
resemblance to the real thing, that it would have been hard to discover
the deception in the subdued light of the &#8220;Den.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is very easy to see what happened. So soon as the steel knife
approached the dish, the magnet within the faked tongue made the
latter leap up to meet the knife and cling to it. Of course, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
fork was plunged through the thin outer coating of meat it struck the
tin, making it crack in a strange manner. In <a href="#Fig25_7">Fig. 7</a> is shown the
method of fixing the magnet, the whole faked tongue being shown in
section. A number of experiments had to be undertaken before the
trick could be made to work satisfactorily,
but in the end Bobbie was quite pleased with
the result of his labors.</p>

<div class="figleft w300" id="Fig25_7">

<img src="images/illo209a.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;The mysterious
tongue.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The whole success of the potato trick
depended upon Dolly, who worked the simple
apparatus to perfection. Attached to the
handle of the lid was a strong piece of wire,
which the half-light rendered invisible. This
passed through a loop in the ceiling and over
to the curtain, to enable that young lady to pull. A second wire was
attached to it that pulled the cover and the potatoes out of sight.
<a href="#Fig25_8">Fig. 8</a> will show how this was arranged. A ring C is put in the ceiling
A B over the tureen. From the lid E a wire D passes up through this
ring and along the ceiling to the back of the curtain G. Upon the
wire D a ring H is threaded, whilst attached to this ring is another
length of wire F, that also passes behind the curtain.</p>

<p>By pulling the wire D the lid of the tureen is naturally raised
to the ceiling at C. When it has reached the top, it is only
necessary to pull the
wire F, and pay out
the wire D, to make
the whole lid travel
towards G. Each of
the potatoes had been
previously attached
to the lid by a wire
about ten inches long,
with the exception of
the small one that remained
in the dish,
which had a separate
arrangement of
thread, similar to that
of the lid, all to itself.</p>

<p>The movement of
the bottle upon the table was caused by the inflation of a little india-rubber
bulb beneath the cloth, and worked by the host as he sat at
the table.</p>

<img src="images/illo209b.png" alt="" width="500" height="393" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The disappearing potatoes.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The excitement of his guests having been thus aroused it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
very simple matter for Bobby Cargill to move the table with his knees,
whilst by dexterously pulling a string Dolly was able to overturn the
little table laden with books (<a href="#Fig25_4">Fig. 4</a>, H). To add to all this confusion
Dolly then began slowly to lower the light, tap the wall by her side,
and utter dismal groans. She then clothed herself in a white sheet,
opened the curtains, and made her way out of the room with all haste.
Little wonder that general consternation ensued!</p>

<p>It only remains to be mentioned that the speaking tube concealed
amongst the flowers in the center-piece was sufficient to carry the
laughter from one of the servants, who, acting under instructions,
stood without the room. It proved the climax, and peace was scarcely
restored until they were all sitting below with the Ghost herself, and
partaking of a real supper without any faked tongue.</p>

<p>As they all agreed, it was not a bad scare for the money, as a very
small sum represented the entire outlay for working The Mysterious
Room.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXVI</b><br />
MECHANICAL SECOND-SIGHT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Approaching the Supernatural</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> exhibition of so-called hypnotism and second-sight is a favorite
item in the programmes of many professional entertainers. If well
managed, the performance appears miraculous, and is sure to impress
the majority of the audience as savoring strongly of the supernatural.
The exhibition is usually somewhat of the following nature.</p>

<p>A young lady is presented to the audience as being possessed of
the marvelous faculty of second-sight, so keenly developed that she is
able to see and describe whatever falls under the observation of her
double. Needless to say, this individual is the performer who introduces
her. Having given this explanation, Prof. B, as he may be
called, bandages the eyes of the gifted young lady, Mlle. C, and seats
her on the stage in full view of the spectators.</p>

<p>The Professor now walks amongst his audience and asks some
person to whisper a number. This having been done, he calls out
to Mlle. C, desiring her to state this whispered number, which she
cannot possibly have heard. Without the least hesitation Mlle. answers
correctly.</p>

<p>The Professor will perhaps now ask for a coin, and at his request
she will describe it accurately, give its date and value, and any other
particulars desired. In the same way she will give the number of a
bank-note, describe any article the Professor may happen to be holding
in his hand, or even tell to what he is pointing.</p>

<p>With many other tricks as wonderful and mysterious does the
Professor attempt to beguile the audience into a belief in his occult
powers. It may be very uncharitable to give the Professor&#8217;s deceptions
away, but that is what this chapter will do for the benefit of
its readers.</p>

<p>The whole secret lies in a private code understandable only by the
two performers. By using this Prof. B tells his accomplice exactly
what she has to answer, gives her the numbers and describes the
objects, quite unknown to his listeners. All that is necessary is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
good memory and quick hearing. Given these essentials, the rest is
simple.</p>

<p>Let us begin by describing the code with which the Professor
apprises Mlle. C of the various numbers chosen by the audience.</p>

<p>The units are expressed by letters from which Prof. B forms
sentences when addressing Mlle. C. A very commonly used code is
<span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="dontwrap" summary="Code">

<tr>
<td class="center padr1">1</td>
<td colspan="2" class="center">is represented by</td>
<td class="left padl1">t</td>
</tr>

<td class="left padl1">r</td>

<td class="left padl1">l</td>

<td class="center padr1">6</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">h</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center padr1">7</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">k, g, or c</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center padr1">8</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">f, v, or w</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center padr1">9</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">p or b</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center padr1">0</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">s or z</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>To use this code properly two things are necessary. Mlle. C must
know how many figures the number consists of, and she must also
know when the code is finished.</p>

<p>The latter point is easily settled. When she hears the words, &#8220;if
you please,&#8221; she knows that whatever follows has no code meaning
whatever, whilst everything that precedes these words carries a hidden
meaning.</p>

<p>By the use of the following words the number of figures is
conveyed in a perfectly unmistakable manner.</p>

<table class="dontwrap" summary="Code">

<td class="left">For&nbsp;</td>
<td class="left">one</td>

<p>The following explanation shows how to put this into practice.
Taking all the numbers successively from one to ten (a thing that
would never be done in an ordinary way), Prof. B conveys to his
fair friend the desired information by means of the sentences subjoined.</p>

<table class="left dontwrap" summary="Code">

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span></p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;This seems an easy number. (t = 1, s = 0; &#8220;number&#8221;
means two figures. <i>Ans.</i> 10.)</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Now, please, tell this number. (n = 2, p = 9; word &#8220;number&#8221;
means two figures. <i>Ans.</i> 29.)</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Very well, let me know this. (&#8220;Very well&#8221; means three
figures; l = 5, m = 3, k = 7. <i>Ans.</i> 537.)</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Very good, Mlle. Now repeat clearly what this is, if you
please. (&#8220;Very good, Mlle.,&#8221; means six figures; n = 2, r = 4, c = 7,
w = 8, t = 1, s = 0. <i>Ans.</i> 247810.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the Professor asks some person present to come upon
the stage, and write certain figures upon a blackboard provided for the
purpose. The method of communicating the numbers is the same,
but the Professor in this instance points to each figure in turn, tells it
to the lady, and awaits her reply before proceeding. For example,
suppose the number 638219 to have been written by a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Very good, sir (turning to Mlle. C). How many figures
have been written upon the board?</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Six.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> (pointing to first figure)&mdash;How about this? (h = 6.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Six.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;May I ask this? (m = 3.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Three.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Well! (w = 8.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Eight.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Now, if you please. (n = 2.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Two.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;This? (t = 1.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;One.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Please. (p = 9.)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Nine.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;That is all right. (This is invariably understood to mean
that the experiment is completed.)</p>

<p>Should any smart person write a number like 99999, and smile
expectantly, awaiting the Professor&#8217;s confusion, he will be doomed to
disappointment, for Prof. B merely says to him &#8220;Very good&#8221;: and
turning to Mlle. C, says &#8220;Please,&#8221; and she answers immediately, &#8220;There
are five nines.&#8221; Of course the Professor&#8217;s &#8220;very good&#8221; has told her
that there are five figures, and the &#8220;please&#8221; has told her that they
begin with nine. Finding that the Professor does not say anything
more, she presumes they are all the same, and replies accordingly.</p>

<p>This system of coding is applied in a similar manner to the letters
of the alphabet, and by this means any word can be easily spelled.
But to avoid detection, the letters have to be transposed somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
after the following fashion, which must only be considered as an
example, being too easy of detection for practical use.</p>

<p>To show how this is used, it may be supposed that the Professor
has in his hand a brown cap, which some little boy in the audience
has given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do be quick, if you please, and tell me what I have in my hand?&#8221;
(d = c, b = a, q = p.)</p>

<p>&#8220;A cap,&#8221; answers Mlle. C.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, say precisely, if you please, what color?&#8221; (c = b, s = r,
p = o.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a brown cap,&#8221; answers she.</p>

<p>This system can be simplified yet further by coding the various
objects most likely to be required, in a way similar to the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Touch = part of clothing.</p>

<p>Look at = part of the room.</p>

<p>Point = part of figure.</p>

<p>Oh yes! = letter or piece of paper.</p>

<p>Most certainly = coin, other than money.</p>

<p>Yes, if you like = a watch.</p>

<p>This is harder = some trinket.</p>

<p>I am afraid this is harder = a ring.</p>

<p>An excellent idea = a playing card.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">As an example of how this code can be employed, it may be
imagined that the Professor lays his hand casually upon a gentleman&#8217;s
coat-sleeve.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;What am I touching?</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;A part of some one&#8217;s clothing.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Tell me fully what, if you please? (t = s, m = l, f = e,
w = v; which reads &#8220;sleeve.&#8221;)</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;I can dimly see a sleeve.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Have you found only a sleeve? (h = g, f = e, o = n;
reading &#8220;gent.&#8221;)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span></p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;Yes, I see a gentleman&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>Or as another example, imagine that some one produces a
seal.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> (loud enough for Mlle. C to hear)&mdash;This is harder. This
fairly bothers me (looking at it closely).</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i> (who has understood &#8220;This is harder&#8221; to mean a trinket, and
&#8220;this fairly bothers me&#8221; to read <i>Seal</i>)&mdash;I can see quite plainly that
it is a seal.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Both initials, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;A, and then H.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;Hurry up, if you please. What metal is it made of?</p>

<p><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;It is made of gold.</p>

<p>This last answer is based upon another code for the various metals,
which may be something like <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Some person in the audience hands the Professor a silver cigarette
case, and, looking up to the stage, he <span class="nowrap">remarks&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This is harder. Come, perfectly, now!&#8221; (c = b, p = o, now = x.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a box,&#8221; murmurs Mlle. C dreamily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Describe it.&#8221; (d = silver.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It is made of silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do just have something further, if you please.&#8221; (d = c, j = i,
h = g, s = r, f = e&mdash;making &#8220;cigre.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like a cigarette box&mdash;a cigarette case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us know the number of cigarettes in it?&#8221; (l = 5.)</p>

<p>&#8220;There are five cigarettes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just say, if you please, what kind?&#8221; (w = v, j = i, s = r.)</p>

<p>&#8220;They are cigarettes of Virginia tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>Money should be designated by N, which, as you remember, is the
code letter for M. The following will then come in <span class="nowrap">handy:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Gold is coded as 1, silver as 2, copper as 3, and paper as 4.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you please, tell me what I have in my hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nature?&#8221; (n = 2 = silver.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, if you please, how you would describe this coin?&#8221; (l = 5,
s = 0.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a fifty-cent piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The piece seems new?&#8221; (t = 1, p = 9, s = 0, n = 2.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The date is 1902.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>Holding out a handful of money, containing say, a five-dollar gold
piece, two fifty-cent pieces, four quarters, and five cents in copper,</p>

<p>The Professor says, &#8220;Tell this, if you please, the number of coins
in my hand?&#8221; (t = 1, t = 1.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven,&#8221; answers Mlle. C.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. Now, Mademoiselle, if you please, tell me the nature of
it?&#8221; (t = 1 = gold, n = 2 = silver, m = 3 = copper.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold, silver, and copper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving, if you please, the others, let us start with the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A five-dollar gold piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you please, silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see two dollars in silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likewise, if you please, the copper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The code for playing cards should be formed in much the same
way. The following is a suggestion of what might be <span class="nowrap">arranged:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The cards, commencing with the ace and finishing with the king,
should be numbered one to thirteen inclusive. The suits can then be
distinguished <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Good = hearts; very good = diamonds; well = clubs; very well =
spades.</p>

<p>Supposing that the Professor has handed a pack of cards to some
person among the spectators, who has drawn the knave of clubs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; says the Professor. &#8220;There tell, if you please,
what card this is?&#8221; (Very well = clubs, there tell = eleven, <i>i.e.</i> the
knave.)</p>

<p>&#8220;You are holding the knave of clubs in your hand,&#8221; replies
Mlle. C.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Look, if you please, and tell what this is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The five of hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Mademoiselle. Tell me, if you please, what this
card is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The king of diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ace of spades.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point it is not an uncommon thing for some skeptical person
present to take a card and demand to know its value without having
shown it to the Professor. The latter rises to the occasion immediately.
He explains that Mademoiselle can only see what he actually sees
himself, her sight being second to his own. Casually drawing a card,
and not showing it to anybody, he remarks, &#8220;Very well, Mademoiselle,
tell me, if you please, what this is?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The three of clubs,&#8221; she answers; and the Professor then shows
the card to all, demonstrating the skill of the gifted lady.</p>

<p>For an extensive programme a greater number of codes is necessary.
We give an idea for some of these which may prove of use. An unfailing
memory is essential to second-sight, and the greater the number
of codes that can be learned, the more sure of success can both
performers feel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this before me? Be descriptive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A red carnation,&#8221; replies the lady unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you please, what is this flower?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a violet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor and Mlle. C have nearly finished their entertainment.
But before bowing farewell to the company, he approaches
a little girl, let us say in the audience, and in a whisper asks her age.
With the utmost secrecy she informs him that she is just nine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, how old is my little friend here?&#8221; he demands of Mlle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine years old,&#8221; she replies at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; whispers the Professor to the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; she whispers back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now! Be sure! Having found so easily, if you please, her
age, what is the young lady&#8217;s name?&#8221; (N = m, b = a, s = r, h = g,
f = e, s = r, easily = y.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name is Margery,&#8221; is the reply; and with this pretty
example of his power, the Professor will close the evening.</p>

<p>I have dealt at such length with the Professor and his codes, because
it is the easiest and most general system of mechanical second-sight.
But Professor B and Mlle. C have yet another system of second-sight,
more puzzling still to the spectators, as not a word is exchanged between
either of the confederates during the whole performance.</p>

<p>Seating the lady upon the stage, facing the audience, and omitting
to bandage her eyes, Professor B goes down amongst the spectators
as before, examines various articles, is told different numbers and
touches sundry objects exactly as in the former entertainment. Without
speaking a single word he merely glances at Mlle. C, who after
a few seconds mentions the number or describes the article as the case
may be.</p>

<p>All this is highly mysterious, and is the result of a very ingenious
mode of signaling which may be thus explained.</p>

<p>As soon as Professor B raises his eyes to Mlle. C they both start
counting to themselves, and the instant he drops his eyes they cease.
This has been practiced over and over again until they have learned
to count exactly at the same speed. The result is that when the Professor
has counted five, let us say, Mlle. C has counted five also, and so with
any number.</p>

<p>The alphabet is then coded with numbers according to the following
system.</p>

<table class="alphacode" summary="Code">

<p>The letters are represented by the vertical figures on the left and
the horizontal figures on the top, and by this ingenious means are
communicated.</p>

<p>To signal the letter A the Professor would glance up at Mlle. C,<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
count one, and then glance down again; he would then look up and
count six and lower his eyes once more.</p>

<p>Supposing that some lady had lent a diamond ring, the process
would be the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(The letter U shows when the Professor raised his eyes, and the
letter D when he lowered them. The dots designate the numbers he
would count in the interval.)</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;(without speaking).&nbsp; U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp; D = R,
U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
D = I, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = N, U
&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp; D = G.</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;You have a ring in your hand.</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;U &nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = D, U
&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = M, U
&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D,
U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = N.</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;It is a diamond ring.</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Prof.</i>&mdash;U &nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = C = 3.</p>

<p class="hind212"><i>Mlle.</i>&mdash;It has three stones.</p>

<p>With reference to this last answer it must be explained that the
numerals are represented by the letters of the alphabet, A = 1, B = 2,
C = 3, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Or again some person holds a bank-note numbered 15498. The
Professor communicates this number <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind212">U .&nbsp; D, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = 1, U
.&nbsp; D, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = 5, U .&nbsp; D, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
D = 4, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = 9, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D, U .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; D = 8.</p>

<p>Mlle. C then remarks, &#8220;The number is 15498.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cumbersome as this may seem at first, a little practice enables the
signaling and translating to be done with great rapidity. All the codes
previously described can be introduced, numbers being substituted for
letters, or letters for numbers, as may seem expedient.</p>

<p>Mechanical second-sight has an extraordinary effect in an entertainment
if well done. Both the Professor and his accomplice must be
sharp and sure, the least mistake being not only disconcerting, but
likely to arouse the suspicions of the spectators. If a mistake be made,
the only thing to be done is for the Professor to pretend that he has
himself mistaken the number or not noticed the object properly, and
if this fail he must have recourse to pure &#8220;bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>All things considered, the number of out-of-the-way objects likely
to be produced is really very few, and there is no reason why an
intelligent couple of amateurs with retentive memories should not
provide a successful exhibition of second-sight wherewith to amuse
their credulous friends.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXVII</b><br />
PAPERGRAPHY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">How an Excellent Entertainment may be Given
with a Sheet of Paper</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greatest attraction wielded by Papergraphy is, perhaps, the extreme
simplicity of the apparatus required.</p>

<p>At first sight it seems utterly impracticable that a first-class entertainment,
of almost a quarter of an hour&#8217;s duration, can be given with
a sheet of paper. Moreover, very little practice is necessary.</p>

<p>Cartridge paper is the kind usually employed by professional
entertainers, and a suitable size is 54 inches by 36. A sheet of these
dimensions may be purchased from any stationer&#8217;s or dealer in artists&#8217;
requisites.</p>

<p>The paper must be marked out lengthwise into five parts; the
central section being 12 inches wide and the two on each side 6 inches
in width. The paper should next be folded along these lines (<a href="#Fig27_1">Fig. 1</a>),
and once again folded into a series of pleats, as depicted in <a href="#Fig27_2">Fig. 2</a>.
A convenient width for these pleats is 1 inch.</p>

<p>All being now ready for the first demonstration in Papergraphy,
commence by forming a <i>Rosette</i> (<a href="#Fig27_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span></p>

<p>Close up the pleated paper, and pull round the corners of each
until they meet.</p>

<p><i>Table Mat</i> (<a href="#Fig27_4">Fig. 4</a>). Keeping hold of the ends of the rosette, stretch
out the pleats as far as possible.</p>

each end up, almost at right angles.</p>

<p>After a little practice, all that it is necessary to do in order to
give a successful entertainment is to learn the correct order in which
the transformations take place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span></p>

<p>For the first two or three performances it is a good plan to write out
a list of the various &#8220;folds&#8221; upon a small slip of paper, which should
be placed in such a position that a hasty glance
can be thrown at it in case of the memory failing.</p>

<p>As will doubtless have been noticed, the different
folds have been so arranged in the article that each
transformation leads up to the next. It is therefore
of great importance that the performer should
remember their correct order. Otherwise he may
suddenly find himself attempting to make a fold
with only one pleat opened, when really three are
required.</p>

<p>It is at such moments as these that the young
entertainer wishes the ground would open beneath
him, that a cyclone would whisk him away, or that
any other phenomenon might occur which would carry him beyond
the gaze of his inquisitive audience.</p>

<p>When making a fresh transformation, the performer should move
his arms gently from side to side, and sway
slightly from the hips&mdash;very much as though he
were holding a concertina. This will lead the
audience into the belief that he is engaged upon
some extremely difficult fold, and will completely
hide the simple movement he is really making.</p>

<p>If the performer is a good elocutionist, and
possesses plenty of self-confidence, he might
prepare some &#8220;patter&#8221; to go with the performance.
An excellent alternative, however, is
to ask somebody to play a dreamy waltz from
the piano throughout the performance.</p>

<p>It will then only be necessary for the entertainer
to make a few introductory remarks before
commencing his &#8220;show&#8221;; to announce the name of each transformation
as he makes it, and finally to thank the audience for the attention
with which they have followed his few experiments in Papergraphy.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Master the Principles of the Art</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no reason why any boy possessed of an average amount
of dexterity should not be able to perform many juggling tricks after
a certain amount of careful and patient practice. By a close study of
the following instructions, a clear idea of the principles of the art can
be obtained; and when these principles have been mastered, the
beginner should have no difficulty in elaborating the tricks to
suit his own fancy.</p>

<p>As the system of juggling with knives, plates, or clubs is
founded entirely upon the methods employed in manipulating
balls, the simplest plan is to learn the tricks with these last
before adapting them to larger objects.</p>

<p>Any kind of ball may be employed for juggling, but the
specially-prepared balls, made of heavy metal, are the best,
and can be purchased for a small sum in a set of four from
any dealer in games.</p>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Vertical Fall</span></h3>

<p>A ball should be thrown into the air in such a manner
that it will descend to the exact point from which it was
projected, as in <a href="#Fig28_1">Fig. 1</a>. It is quite unnecessary to throw the
ball higher than four feet. By an observation of the usual
method of catching a ball, it will be noticed that the hand
usually follows the course of the ball; but the great object
of the juggler is to learn to catch without moving the
hand from the position it occupied when throwing the ball
into the air.</p>

<p>The great point of the vertical fall is to teach the beginner to move
his hands as little as possible, and for this reason the exercise should
be practiced with both right and left until such precision is acquired
that the movement can be accomplished with the eyes closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span></p>

<h3 id="Ref4">2. <span class="smcap">Inside and Outside Falls</span></h3>

<p>The inside fall is done by throwing the ball with the right hand, in
such a way that it describes a curve and drops towards the left, as
in Fig. 2. But instead of catching it with the left hand, catch it with
the right by a rapid movement of the hand across the body. The ball
being held in the right hand, it should be thrown back from left to
right in a similar way, as in Fig. 3. The latter is called the outside fall.</p>

<p>This exercise is intended to teach the beginner to throw the ball
several times in succession from side to side without its deviating
from its course. The principle involved is very important for
jugglery, and must be thoroughly acquired before proceeding with
other tricks.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Parallel Fall</span></h3>

<p>This fall presents greater difficulties. The ball should be thrown
with the right hand, as in the vertical fall, although the hand must be
kept in a line with the shoulder. As soon as the ball has been caught,
the hand must be rapidly brought into line with the left shoulder, the
ball thrown from that position, and caught (<a href="#Fig28_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Having learned the trick with the right hand, it is essential to
become accustomed to perform it equally well with the left hand,
moving it to the right shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span></p>

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Falls from Right to Left</span></h3>

<p>Both hands are required for these falls, which are simply an
adaptation of what has just been described. The ball should be
thrown exactly as described in <a href="#Ref4">No. 2</a>, but instead of moving the right
hand across the body to catch the ball when it falls on the left side, the
left hand should catch it, as in <a href="#Fig28_5">Fig. 5</a>, and should immediately return
it by means of the outside fall to the right hand. But little practice is
required to learn this perfectly, and when smartly performed it makes a
pretty display.</p>

<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Horizontal Pass</span></h3>

<p>In this exercise the ball should be thrown from hand to hand
in as straight a line as possible (<a href="#Fig28_6">Fig. 6</a>), whilst the beginner must
endeavor, by continually increasing the distance between his hands,
to maintain a rapid volley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span></p>

<h3>6. <span class="smcap">The Double Vertical Fall</span></h3>

<p>This is the first trick requiring two balls, and will need some
attention. A ball should be taken in each hand, and the simple
vertical fall performed with the right. Before this ball has descended,
however, the ball in the left hand must be thrown in the air, as in
<a href="#Fig28_7">Fig. 7</a>, so that the two balls are continually in motion. It is at this
point that the juggler will find the advantage of being proficient in the
use of both hands for the single vertical fall.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right0550-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>A variation of this double fall can be acquired in the following
<span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Both balls should be thrown up at the same time, as in <a href="#Fig28_8">Fig. 8</a>,
the hands being kept about two feet apart, care being taken that
neither of the balls is thrown higher than the other.</p>

<p>The beginner must practice these thoroughly until perfectly accustomed
to having the two balls in motion simultaneously.</p>

<h3>7. <span class="smcap">The Double Inside Fall</span></h3>

<p>This is a repetition of the outside and inside falls, but performed
with two balls at once, and with both hands. The utmost care must<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
be exercised to avoid a collision as they pass one another, and for this
reason one ball must be thrown higher than the other, as in <a href="#Fig28_9">Fig. 9</a>.
Until proficiency is attained the balls should be thrown at various
heights, and the hands well apart.</p>

<h3>8. <span class="smcap">The Triple Pass</span></h3>

<p>Having acquired the last trick perfectly, the beginner should now
bring into use a third ball. A glance at <a href="#Fig28_10">Fig. 10</a> will show that the
triple pass is nothing but the double inside fall performed with an
additional ball.</p>

<p>Two balls are held in the left hand, and one in the right, the
former being numbered 1 and 3, and the latter 2. Ball No. 1 is
thrown from the left hand, and as soon as it is in the air, No. 2 is sent
off from the right, after which No. 3 is thrown from the left hand. It
will be noticed from <a href="#Fig28_10">Fig. 10</a> that No. 1 is sent the highest and No. 3
the lowest, and by this means a collision can best be avoided. The
greatest care must be taken to throw the balls regularly, otherwise
confusion will ensue.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>To keep up the volley, each ball must be sent off again as soon as
it has been caught, so that after the first throw neither hand holds
more than one ball at a time.</p>

<h3>9. <span class="smcap">The Triple Over Pass</span></h3>

<p>The only difference between this and the Triple Pass is that each
ball, as thrown, passes over instead of under the ball that precedes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
This is shown in <a href="#Fig28_11">Fig. 11</a>, where No. 2 passes over No. 1, whilst No. 3
is thrown the highest of all. This trick is usually combined with the
ordinary Triple Pass, and from the spectator&#8217;s point of view presents
no difference.</p>

<h3>10. <span class="smcap">The Shower</span></h3>

<p>This is one of the prettiest of all the tricks of Juggling, and should
be learned with two balls. Take a ball in each hand and throw the
right one in the air towards the left, whilst as soon as it is in the air
pass the left hand ball to the right hand, as in <a href="#Fig28_12">Fig. 12</a>. The moment
this latter ball has been caught it must be thrown up in the wake of
the first ball, and the whole trick continued as quickly as possible, so
that one ball is always in the air.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>This should be practiced continually until perfection is attained, as
it forms an introduction <span class="nowrap">to&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>11. <span class="smcap">The Triple Shower</span></h3>

<p>Two balls must be taken in the right hand, and one in the left.
The first two should be thrown in rapid succession from the right to
the left, the ball in the latter hand being passed to the right, as in the
Simple Shower. As each ball reaches the left hand pass it rapidly
across, as in <a href="#Fig28_13">Fig. 13</a>, and start it off in the air once more.</p>

<p>The trick has the effect of making the spectators imagine that you
have a large number of balls in your hands, and the more quickly the
trick is done the greater the deception. By starting with three balls in
the right hand and one in the left a still prettier display can be provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
with little extra trouble. In this case, however, the balls will have to
be thrown rather higher to give the left hand more time to catch the
balls and pass them successfully.</p>

<p>As a final exercise the beginner should <span class="nowrap">learn&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>12. <span class="smcap">The Double Over Fountain</span></h3>

<p>Four balls are required for this, a couple being taken in each
hand, Nos. 1 and 3 being in the left and Nos. 2 and 4 in the right
hand.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 are thrown up simultaneously in the simple Vertical
Fall, as in A, <a href="#Fig28_14">Fig. 14</a>. The hands are then rapidly moved apart and
balls Nos. 3 and 4 are thrown over the first two balls in such a
manner that they cross each other and are caught in the opposite
hands (<a href="#Fig28_14">Fig. 14</a>). The volley with those two balls is immediately
returned and the hands are brought nearer together to catch and
throw Nos. 1 and 2 again. Thus the fountain is kept up indefinitely.
It will be observed that the two hands constantly approach and separate,
as the two sets of balls are caught in turn, and such action must be
very smartly performed.</p>

<p>The substitution of clubs or knives for balls can be easily effected,
although the performance is none the better for the change. In
using knives, the juggler should see that the handles are well
weighted to insure that part of the object falling into his hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
The substitution of knives is not sufficiently interesting to compensate
for the additional risk, and the amateur may very well dispense with
them.</p>

<p>Plates and clubs are equally unwieldy, and the juggler can scarcely
do better than content himself with the plain balls, the manipulation of
which is certain to provide a pretty and interesting entertainment at
all times.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXIX</b><br />
PLATE-SPINNING AND WALTZING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Exciting Entertainment</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> things are productive of such literally breathless interest as
plate-spinning. In what a state of agonized anxiety your audience will
be as they watch you imperturbably spinning a soup-plate on the end
of a rod. How they will catch their breaths as they expect it to
fall, and how surprised they will be when it keeps its position! Yet
if you inform them that it is not so difficult as it looks, you will be
stating a fact, although the art is acquired only after considerable
practice and at the cost of several plates.</p>

<p>To minimize the breakage of crockery it will be as well to begin
your experiments with a mattress laid upon the floor, or failing this,
with a good substantial down comforter. The first attempts will not then
be accompanied by such mortality amongst the plates.</p>

<p>Procure a rod or wand upon which the plates are to be spun. A
round stick, about 2 feet long,
is the most suitable for the purpose.
Care should be taken to
see that it is straight, and it must
be well sand-papered in order to remove any roughness (<a href="#Fig29_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig29_1">

<img src="images/illo233.png" alt="" width="600" height="40" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Spinning wand.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Now reduce one end of the stick to a dull point, which must
further be prepared by a rather strange process. Place this pointed
end in your mouth and moisten it until it is quite soft and all the
hardness of the wood has been removed. When properly softened
the fiber of the wood will remain whilst all the &#8220;starch&#8221;&mdash;if one may
so call it&mdash;has disappeared. This preparation gives the stick a certain
grip on the plate which is indispensable for successful spinning.</p>

<p>Next take a soup-plate, as in <a href="#Fig29_2">Fig. 2</a>, and make it revolve rapidly
upon the dull end of the rod. To do this the following instructions
and hints should be noted.</p>

<p>The rod should have a rapid circular motion imparted to it by the
wrist, so that it cuts a circle of about the same circumference as the
soup-plate. The arm should be motionless, the whole movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
being confined to the wrist. The beginner must not expect immediate
success, but after considerable practice the knack of describing the
circle with the end of the rod will be acquired.</p>

<p>Now, by making these circles with the plate upon the end of the
wand you will find that the plate itself begins to spin rapidly, and at
length, when it has attained a certain velocity, it finds its center upon
the point of the rod and revolves so steadily as to appear motionless
(<a href="#Fig29_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>Practice spinning with the left hand as well as with the right, for
in many cases it is necessary to transfer the wand from one hand to
the other. Probably you will find greater difficulty with the left
hand, but perseverance is all that is required&mdash;perseverance and the
mattress!</p>

<div class="split5050">

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>It is a great mistake to choose a light plate for spinning. The
heavier it is the easier it will be to spin, and you will find that dishes
(not necessarily round) will be the best spinners of all. Do not forget
that very heavy dishes soon tire the wrist and make it too unsteady
for successfully exhibiting other tricks.</p>

<p>So far the <i>modus operandi</i> with unprepared and ordinary plates has
been described. It is quite as well that the learner should begin with
these, as the greater difficulty in balancing and spinning will have
taught a lesson that will render him more at ease with the prepared
plates.</p>

<p>Procure another wand, which need not be &#8220;softened.&#8221; Sharpen
one end into a point, not so dull as in the former case, but with a
clearly defined apex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prepared Plates</span></h3>

<p>As to the prepared plates. Take for example a thick soup-plate.
From the center of the bottom of this plate a small, shallow piece
must be drilled away, as in <a href="#Fig29_4">Fig. 4</a>,
which represents a section of the
article. Any china riveter will
do this for you, and will, at your
request, polish the cavity after it
has been drilled. Explain the
purpose for which you want it done, as that will insure his making
the hole in the dead center.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig29_4">

<img src="images/illo235a.png" alt="" width="500" height="121" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Plate with drilled cavity for
spinning.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>You will now find that this plate not only spins much more easily,
but will continue revolving upon the rod for a great while, even after
you have ceased working the latter with your wrist. This is an
important consideration in view of the balancing feats to be
accomplished.</p>

<p>The next thing to practice is catching the plates in mid-air upon
the tip of your wand. This is not so difficult as it sounds, and should
be easily learned. Toss the plate upwards, as you do so giving it a
smart turn or twist to the right, so that it revolves rapidly upon its
own center while ascending.</p>

<p>Now bring the point of the rod under it, and as the plate reaches
its highest point in the air it will turn over and you will have an
opportunity to get the stick into the hole in the center. The plate
will then spin upon the point of the rod, and a few turns with the
wrist will increase its speed and keep it going steadily for a time.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig29_5">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Having mastered the principle of catching the plates in the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
described, practice holding the rod and tossing the plate with the same
hand.</p>

<p>Hold the stick near to the point and between the fingers and the
thumb (<a href="#Fig29_5">Fig. 5</a>), whilst the outspread fingers are in the bowl of the
plate, as in <a href="#Fig29_6">Fig. 6</a>. These are shown separately to give a clearer idea
of the meaning. Now, toss the plate into the air, as has been
explained, again giving the wrist a smart turn to the right. Bring the
rod sharply into position and catch the plate in the usual fashion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Further Feats</span></h3>

<p>Take a couple of rods, one in each hand, and send a plate spinning
on the point of the right-hand rod. By giving a sharp upward jerk
you will send the plate high into the air, and upon its descent you can
catch it upon the end of the other rod. If the plate has been tossed
very high, and is therefore likely to descend with some force, care
must be taken when catching it not to shatter it into pieces. As soon
as the plate touches the point of the wand, lower the latter some
distance with the plate, and thus break the force of the impact&mdash;instead
of breaking the plate.</p>

<p>This performance will prepare you for successfully achieving the
following very effective show. Two persons are required for it,
however, and both must be good spinners.</p>

<div class="figright w200" id="Fig29_7">

<img src="images/illo237a.png" alt="" width="200" height="449" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Plate spinning and
balancing.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Let each performer take a plate and a rod. Then both should
spin their plates, and throw them to each other, catching the plates
upon their respective wands. The volley may then be returned in
the same manner, increasing the speed each time until the plates fly
from one to the other like tennis balls.</p>

<p>The first attempts will probably result in a shower of broken
crockery, but practice will obviate such a palpable disadvantage, and
after a time you will be able to complicate the exhibition by taking
a rod and plate in each hand, thus having four plates flashing to and
fro at the same time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Balancing</span></h3>

<p>Having graduated as a master of spinning and catching plates, the
opportunity has arrived for attempting to balance the spinning dishes.
This is largely a matter of knack, although a sure eye and a steady
hand are indispensable.</p>

<p>Start a plate spinning on a rod, and pass it to the left hand. Do
the same with a second plate, holding the rod likewise in the left hand,
taking great care, of course, that the plates do not collide.</p>

<p>Now with the right hand start off a third plate, and balance the<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
rod upon your forehead or chin, having done which pass one of the
rods back from the left to the right hand. This makes quite a pleasing
exhibition, as can be seen by <a href="#Fig29_7">Fig. 7</a>, and is well worth learning.</p>

<p>Presuming you are now facing the spectators,
with the three plates spinning as in <a href="#Fig29_7">Fig. 7</a>,
the question naturally arises, how to stop the
plates in a graceful manner? There are
several ways of doing this, but the following
will be found the simplest.</p>

<p>Lower the rods in the two hands simultaneously
until the plates can be grasped in
the fingers. Then, with the plate and rod
still balanced upon your face, lay the two
plates upon a convenient table, and taking
one of the rods transfer the rod upon your
chin to its point, and thus balancing one upon
the other bring the plate to rest.</p>

<p>Supposing you have a plate spinning upon
a wand, balanced upon another as in <a href="#Fig29_8">Fig. 8</a>,
practice the following method of dispensing
with one of these rods.</p>

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig29_8">

<img src="images/illo237b.png" alt="" width="250" height="240" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Plate being spun upon
two rods.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>By a sharp upward movement jerk the
plate into the air from the point of rod No. 1.
This will, of course, by relieving the stick of
its burden, make it fall. You then catch the
falling rod smartly with the other hand. But you must not forget
during this time the plate which you have sent, still spinning, towards
the ceiling. Upon its descent catch it neatly
upon the tip of wand No. 2, and the trick is
completed.</p>

<p>Such are the rudiments of the arts of
spinning and balancing. Having acquired
a thorough knowledge of the various exercises
and feats described, the amateur
spinner will have no difficulty in inventing
new things for himself, and will be able to
emulate the feats of professional jugglers.
Much patience and long-suffering are necessary,
but with a quick eye and a sure hand
there is no reason why any person should not be able to provide
a good plate-spinning entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Plate Waltzing</span></h3>

<p>There is a kindred branch of the art which may be described here,
and that is plate waltzing. It is really nothing but an extension of
the trick of spinning a coin upon the
table, which every one has done at
some time or other.</p>

<p>A perfectly level table is essential.
To insure this it is a good plan to
have a smooth, unpolished board that can be laid upon a table and
made perfectly level by adjusting small pieces of cardboard at the
corners. Around the edge a slight
border should be made, rounded
to the surface of the board, as
shown in <a href="#Fig29_9">Fig. 9</a>. This will prevent
the plates
from dancing off
the table and on
to the floor.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;How to set
the plate in motion.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Plates of any
description and
size, from the delicate
tea-plate to
the burly wash-basin
are eligible
for the dance (<a href="#Fig29_10">Fig.
10</a>).</p>

<p>The following is the easiest way to start twirling
a plate. Take a dinner-plate and stand it upon its
edge on the table with the bottom of its upper edge
resting against the extended forefinger, as in <a href="#Fig29_11">Fig. 11</a>.
Describe a small circle with this finger rather quickly,
and the plate will follow its motion. Continue passing
the finger round and round, accelerating the motion
with each revolution. The plate will then begin to
revolve very quickly. Take your finger away when
it has acquired sufficient impetus, and leave the plate
to dance by itself.</p>

<p>Begin learning with one plate. You will find that as it loses its
impetus it begins to go slower and slower, tending to settle bottom
upwards upon the table. But this is where your skill must be proved
in preventing the fall from lack of momentum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the plate is revolving and before the first signs of falling
are apparent, touch the bottom of the plate fairly near the center with
the tip of your finger, moving this latter round in the direction followed
by the plate. This will have the effect of preventing the fall, and will
send the plate dancing on with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Considerable experience will be required to perform this successfully,
as the exact spot to be touched with the finger can only be
ascertained after much practice.</p>

<p>Large and heavy plates make the best dancers, and it will be
necessary sometimes to use two fingers when preventing the fall, for
the pressure must in all cases be firm and steady. An ordinary plate
is better than a soup-plate, for not only is it more elegant, but its even
poise renders the revolutions steadier.</p>

<p>Practice the use of both hands, remembering, however, that the
plates will revolve in different directions according to which hand you
use. The right hand will send a plate twirling from left to right,
whilst the left hand causes an opposite motion.</p>

<p>The plates will keep admirable time to regular waltz music, and
produce a pleasing effect. Keep your eye upon all of them, being
ready to render assistance to any of your dancers that show signs of
subsiding upon the table.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXX</b><br />
THE TIGHT-ROPE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Trick Balancing</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are probably few actions more graceful than those of a skillful
equilibrist. The necessity of maintaining a symmetrical posture and
disposing the body in a well-balanced manner can produce nothing
but a pleasing effect. To a lithe and healthy boy there are endless
opportunities for creating new figures, whilst many will find an attraction
in performing feats rarely attempted by any but professionals.</p>

<p>The whole strain of tight-rope walking is centered in the back.
The rigidity of the legs is also an important factor in maintaining the
balance. For this reason no child
under ten years of age should ever
be allowed to attempt anything of
this sort, for his bones and muscles
will not be sufficiently developed
until then.</p>

<p>All the arrangements for a tight-rope
exhibition can be made in an
ordinary drawing-room. Very few
fixtures are required, and the following
instructions will give an idea
of what must be done.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig30_1">

<img src="images/illo240.png" alt="" width="450" height="356" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Method of fixing bars of wood.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The rope should be about four
feet from the ground, although if the room is lofty the rope may be
even higher. A length of good strong sash-cord should be used, and
thoroughly tested before every performance.</p>

<p>Assuming that the rope is to be stretched at a height of 4 feet,
the supports should be made in the following <span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Two stout bars of wood, not less than 1 inch in diameter and
6 feet long, should be fastened together in the form of an irregular
St. Andrew&#8217;s Cross, as in <a href="#Fig30_1">Fig. 1</a>. They must be fastened by running
a bolt through them at a distance of 1 foot from the top. The
lower ends should then be beveled off at such an angle that the bars
will rest evenly upon the floor. To these beveled ends a metal plate<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
should be fastened, projecting outwards, with a hole through which a
thumb-screw can be passed, as shown in <a href="#Fig30_2">Fig. 2</a>. These plates, together
with the metal screw-plate, which should be fastened over the holes in
the floor, can be bought for a few cents from any
hardware store. The cross-pieces can then be erected
and screwed into position, as shown in <a href="#Fig30_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figright w150" id="Fig30_2">

<img src="images/illo241.png" alt="" width="150" height="298" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Metal plate
and screw.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Strong hooks should now be driven into the
floor just below the wainscoting and in a line with
the screw plates. Lengths of very strong wire are
to connect these hooks with the cross at H (<a href="#Fig30_1">Fig. 1</a>).
When it is remembered that these pieces of wire
bear the whole strain of the rope, it will be evident
that too much care cannot be exercised in making
them secure and trustworthy.</p>

<p>A similar cross with its attachment must then
be erected at the other side of the room where the
tight-rope is to terminate. At the spot H of this
latter cross a piece of bright-colored cloth should
be fastened, for a purpose which will appear later.</p>

<p>The rope can now be stretched between the crosses, every care
being taken to see that it is securely fastened and is not in the least
slack.</p>

<p>To simplify explanation, the two ends of the rope, with their
respective supports, will be called A and B, the latter having the piece
of colored rag. In <a href="#Fig30_3">Fig. 3</a> will be seen the arrangements so far
completed.</p>

<p>For the purpose of mounting the rope and resting between the
turns, a pair of steps should be placed between A and the wall, and so
adjusted that the top step is on a level with the rope, or even slightly
higher, say at 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Balancing Pole</span></h3>

<p>There is much difference of opinion amongst acrobats regarding
the balancing pole. Some prefer it long and heavy, whilst others
dispense with it altogether. Amateurs can scarcely hope to do the
latter, however, and 4 ft. 6 in. may be considered a suitable length.
The pole should be smooth, round, and even, rather heavier than
an ordinary broom-handle. It will probably prove useful to mark
its exact center by a notch.</p>

<p>A mattress must be laid beneath the rope to break any falls.
Thin-soled dancing pumps should be worn, the soles being well
chalked before use.</p>

<p>Such is the apparatus connected with the public performance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
tight-rope walking. The first attempts should be, however, on a rope
suspended much lower, not more than 1 foot from the ground, as it is
useless to try a high rope until the knack of balancing has been
acquired.</p>

<p>The assistance of two friends will be necessary for the first few
trials. Each must hold a strap fastened around the performer&#8217;s
waist to support him until he has learned to find the center of
gravity. As he grows accustomed to the work their help will become
less necessary, and he will soon be able to dispense with their services.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig30_3">

<img src="images/illo242.png" alt="" width="600" height="399" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Tight-rope ready for walking.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>With the pole balanced in his hands, his eyes fixed steadily upon the
colored rag at B, known as the &#8220;point of sight,&#8221; and, supported by
his two friends, the first essay is made upon the rope. The feet should
be turned out as much as possible, and at each step the heel first and
then the great toe placed upon the rope.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Forward Walk&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>According to the recognized canons of the art, the first thing to be
learnt is the &#8220;Forward Walk.&#8221; The gaze must never leave the &#8220;point
of sight.&#8221; Each step must be made with the utmost care, and perfect
confidence gained before any attempt is made at more difficult tasks.
As soon as the feet begin to feel sore or tired, practice should be
abandoned for that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span></p>

<p>The next thing to be learned is walking backwards. This is really
no harder than the &#8220;Forward Walk&#8221; and can be as easily acquired.
The eye should be steadfastly fixed on the rag as in the former case.
With the amateur there is always a tendency to run. This must be
checked, and a stately gait acquired from the beginning.</p>

<p>After the &#8220;Forward&#8221; and the &#8220;Backward&#8221; walks comes the
&#8220;Forward Spring.&#8221; Both this and the &#8220;Backward Spring&#8221; are
difficult, and can only be learned by constant practice and patience.
There will doubtless be a price to pay in the way of harmless falls
and stumblings, but everything can be learned in time. Indeed, few
instructions can be given that would prove of any real assistance to
the beginner. When once a person has learned to ride a bicycle, the
matter of balancing comes naturally; so with rope walking. As soon
as the tyro has gained confidence and experience on the rope, the
difficulties of the &#8220;jumps&#8221; will gradually disappear.</p>

<p>Having learned the walks and leaps on the tight-rope, it only
remains for the performer to adapt them according to his own ideas.
The aim and object of every professional is to produce some novelty
in his branch of the art, and the amateur must imitate him in thinking
out some effective show to be produced &#8220;up aloft.&#8221; The great Blondin
used to wheel out a barrow and cook his pancakes upon a rope suspended
at an incredible height, and it is in ideas such as these that the
art of successful tight-rope walking consists.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXI</b><br />
CLOG DANCING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Novel Entertainment</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the old Morris Dances decayed in the country districts of England,
many of the local customs and manners died with them, and are
now entirely lost; but what is considered a survival can yet be found,
and is familiar to many of us under the name of Clog Dancing.</p>

<p>The old Morris Dancers had attached to their ankles bands of
bells, which sounded with the jerking and kicking of the dancers&#8217;
feet as they kept time with the measure and music of the accompaniment.</p>

<p>The use of these bells has now, however, almost entirely ceased,
and the heavy wooden clog alone remains. In place of the ringing
and jingling, with which the Morris man accompanied his dance, the
clog makes only a tapping against the floor, sharper in its precision, if
less musical than the old bells.</p>

<p>The clogs suitable for drawing-room dancing have wooden soles
and leather &#8220;uppers.&#8221; These can be obtained in endless variety, from
the plain black or red morocco, to the stylish patent leather shoes.</p>

<p>But whatever the style or make of the clogs, one thing is essential&mdash;they
must fit perfectly. The appearance matters little, so long as
the clogs are an exact fit. Nobody present cares to see your feet, but
everybody desires to see a skillful dance, and that cannot be performed
with a loose shoe.</p>

<p>Having obtained the shoes, the next thing to arrange is the floor.
A smooth wood floor, or a slate slab, provide excellent surfaces for
practicing and learning upon, while for the actual drawing-room performance,
a thick, smooth piece of wood, about two and a half feet
square, and neatly polished, is very suitable. This can be moved at
pleasure, and taken away after the performance is concluded, without
any awkward rolling back of carpets or moving of furniture.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to devote a little attention to the more important
steps to be learned. In the diagrams illustrating this subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
the letter R denotes the right, and L the left foot, and this must be
constantly borne in mind to make the illustrations intelligible.</p>

<p>The first and most important thing to remember, is to keep the toes
well turned outwards wherever the nature of the figure does not render
this impossible. A glance at <a href="#Fig31_1">Fig. 1</a> will illustrate this. In all the steps
practice with the left foot is needed more than with the right, as the
latter can generally be trusted to take care of itself.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Step</span></h3>

<p>The first step to learn is the shuffle, which should be attempted
with one foot first, preferably the left.</p>

<p>Stand firmly upon the right foot, and strike the left toe forward
(as in <a href="#Fig31_2">Fig. 2</a>) towards A, at the same time making a tap upon the
floor. Draw it back from A towards B, making another tap. This
should be done repeatedly until it is possible to make the taps in quick
succession and in even time.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Having mastered this with the left foot, acquire the same proficiency
with the right. The ankle must be kept loose and mobile.
Any stiffness or inflexibility will utterly spoil all efforts.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Single and Double Shuffles</span></h3>

<p>Having become familiar with the two taps with both feet, attempts
to use right and left alternately should be made, the while standing
upon the toes. Thus: left forward and back, two taps; right forward
and back, two taps, making in all four taps in rapid and even succession.</p>

<p>This is known as the single shuffle, and it is surprising how many
music hall artists and public performers know no more than this rudimentary
movement. Yet it shows how necessary it is to be perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
easy and familiar with the action, which may be considered, together
with the double shuffle, as the ground-work of the art.</p>

<p>The double shuffle is simply a duplication of the single shuffle.
Each foot goes forward and backwards twice, making four taps for the
right and four for the left, or eight taps in all. This is really no harder
than the single shuffle, and must be learned as thoroughly. Indeed, it
is wise to practice no more steps until these two shuffles have been
perfectly mastered.</p>

<p>Having grown familiar with the steps already described, it is time
to learn some of the variations of the two shuffles. Begin with the
single shuffle and</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref6"><i>Variation No. 1.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Stand upon the toes of both feet, give one tap
with the left toe, and a single shuffle with the right foot. Then one
tap with the right, and a single shuffle with the left. Keep this up
continuously, and as clearly and rapidly as possible, taking care that
the beats are all equal, and that no one tap is louder than any of the
others.</p>

<p>The result will be a continuous roll, like that of a drum, and is very
effective.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>Variation No. 2.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Give one tap with the left foot, and a shuffle with
the right, as in the preceding step, then hop on the left, tap with the
right, shuffle with the left, and hop on the right. This makes eight
taps in all, and produces another continuous roll. By pausing on the
hop each time, another step is apparently introduced, and the smooth
action is varied pleasantly.</p>

<p>The hopping mentioned above does not mean a skip into the air.
It is simply employed to give a tap, and is more for the sake of appearance
than for actual sound.
It can therefore be replaced
by making a tap with the heel,
which is in itself a prominent
feature in the Clog Dance.
Indeed the tap from the heel
is often preferable as being
more characteristic and elegant
than the hop, which has
to be done most gracefully to
look at all well.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref5"><i>Variation No. 3.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Make
one tap with the left toe, shuffle
with the right foot, tap with the left heel, and bring the right toe behind
the left foot, as in <a href="#Fig31_3">Fig. 3</a>, A and B.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig31_3">

<img src="images/illo246.png" alt="" width="300" height="209" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The third variation.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>This must be learned carefully, and repeated in the opposite way&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
is, tap on right toe, shuffle with left foot, tap with right heel,
and finish up by bringing the left toe behind the right foot.</p>

<div class="split4060">

<div class="left4060">

<div class="figcenter w110" id="Fig31_4">

<img src="images/illo247a.png" alt="" width="104" height="228" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The fourth variation.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--left4060-->

<div class="right4060">

<div class="figcenter w160" id="Fig31_5">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;The fifth variation.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right4060-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

<p>Practice both of these steps, and introduce them, one after the other,
in the actual performance.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>Variation No. 4.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Make one tap with the left toe, shuffle with right
foot, tap the right toe, shuffle left foot, tap with right heel, and finish
with the left toe behind the right foot, as in <a href="#Ref5">Variation No. 3</a>. This
should be learned and repeated in the reverse way to the former step,
and the two should be similarly combined to make one continuous
action, which is really elegant to watch.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>Variation No. 5.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Make one tap with the left toe, a shuffle with the
right foot, another tap with the right toe, then a shuffle with the left
foot, a hop on the right toe, finishing with a tap with the left toe either
behind the right foot, as in <a href="#Fig31_4">Fig. 4</a>, or in front of it, as in <a href="#Fig31_5">Fig. 5</a>. Learn
to do this with the feet reversed as before.</p>

<p>If this step be done properly, the result will be a continuous rattle,
which can be kept up indefinitely, the repetitions and reversals following
one another without break or pause of any kind.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Variations of Double Shuffle</span></h3>

<p>These variations require no detailed description. Wherever in the
above-mentioned changes the single shuffle is mentioned, a double
shuffle may be introduced. For example, in <a href="#Ref6">Variation No. 1</a>, for the
double shuffle the instructions should read: Stand upon the toes of
both feet; give one tap with the left toe, and a double shuffle with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
right foot; then one tap with the right, and a double shuffle with the
left.</p>

<p>By treating the other variations in a similar manner, it will be seen
that ten variations of the single and double shuffles can be obtained.
They should all be learned and practiced until there is not the least
difficulty in performing any one or all of them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Slide</span></h3>

<p>There now remains but the <i>Slide</i> to be learned, and as this is one
of the prettiest of all the clog steps, it is well worth taking pains properly
to acquire.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w240" id="Fig31_6">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<div class="figcenter w210" id="Fig31_8">

<img src="images/illo248c.png" alt="" width="208" height="178" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The slide (third position).</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Stand as in <a href="#Fig31_6">Fig. 6</a>, throwing your weight on the left heel and right
toe, which are to be kept stationary. Now move the left toe and the
right heel in the directions shown by the dotted lines. Your feet will
then be in the position shown in <a href="#Fig31_7">Fig. 7</a>. Keep the left toe and the
right heel stationary, and move the
left heel and right toe in the direction
indicated by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig31_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>By continuing this movement you
have a steady gliding action from left
to right, and, reversing the steps, you
can, of course, move back from right
to left.</p>

<p>This is really a hornpipe movement,
but for clog dancing it is very suitable
for the introduction of taps with heels
and toes at every change of position.
It is also possible to introduce shuffles during the movement, but the
plain taps are probably more effective and quite difficult enough to
learn without the introduction of more complicated movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span></p>

<p>It is possible to dance in clogs to any time, or even against time.
Acquire the steps accurately and readily, and the measure will take
care of itself. To practice the shuffles and their variations, the easiest
plan is to have sixteen bars of music of two-four time, or even a verse
of any song set to that time. As the feet become nimble and the actions
familiar, you will be adept at dancing to any time or measure, whilst
with shuffle and tap your feet will twinkle in the most orthodox and
poetic manner.</p>

<p>Practice in the steps described will also enable you to invent movements
for yourself, such as jumping in the air, striking the clogs together
once or twice, rattling the clogs together on the ground, and
numberless other side tricks and fancies. The regular steps are generally
considered the best, however, and should always be executed
when possible, as they form the essence and genius of the whole art.</p>

<p>Clog dancing is tiring, and it is advisable not to make the dance
the central piece of an evening&#8217;s entertainment. It makes a good
accompaniment or &#8220;gag,&#8221; but is not suitable for a <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>.
Adroitly performed it will win approval; and what more can the home
entertainer desire?</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXII</b><br />
SHADOW SHOWS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hand Shadows</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> of us have not lain in bed by candle-light and with more or less
success cast shadows upon the wall. Some may have seen public entertainments
in which shadow pictures formed an important part of the
programme, and have wondered in a dim kind of way how they were
done. From what follows it will be seen how very simple are the
arrangements, and how admirably adapted for a drawing-room entertainment
a shadow theater can prove.</p>

<p>Shadow shows may be divided into three kinds. They <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind26 blankbefore75">1. Hand Shadows&mdash;in which the performer stands in view of
his audience.</p>

<p class="hind26">2. Figure Shadows&mdash;in which he stands behind a screen.</p>

<p class="hind26">3. Puppet Shadow Shows&mdash;in which the shadows of lay figures
are exhibited.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Of these three branches of the art, Hand Shadows are distinctly
the easiest to do, but they do not give scope for great variety, and
although very good in their way, like most good things, are apt to pall
upon an audience, who, it must ever be remembered, have an insatiable
taste for novelty and change.</p>

<p>A screen of white cloth about three feet square should be fastened
to the wall and drawn taut, so as to have no fold or crease. A large
sheet of perfectly smooth white paper will make an equally satisfactory
background.</p>

<p>The best light for casting shadows is given by a candle, which
should not be lighted until a minute or so after the lights have been
turned out. This will have the effect of making its light appear all the
more brilliant.</p>

<p>Before attempting to give an exhibition of the various shadows,
exercise the fingers to make them pliable. Clench the fist and try to
raise one finger without moving the others. Raise each finger in turn
and they will soon become supple; then you may commence learning
to make the pictures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span></p>

<p>The candle should be on a level with the hand, and you must
stand rather to one side of the
screen, in order that your body
may not interfere with the view
of the audience.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Make the
Pictures</span></h3>

<div class="split5050">

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>In <a href="#Fig32_1">Fig. 1</a> you see the well-known
rabbit, usually the first
shadow made by the amateur
performer. Stretch the right thumb down and the forefinger up as
far as it will go, whilst
the second and third fingers
should be thrust out,
slightly bent, as shown
in the figure. With the
left hand crook the forefinger
against the upright
forefinger of the right
hand, bring the thumb to
touch the last-mentioned
finger, making a little
loop as depicted. Stick the second and third fingers of the left hand
upright, although slightly
bent. Your two hands
should now appear as in
<a href="#Fig32_1">Fig. 1</a>, and the shadow they
cast will be that of a rabbit.</p>

<p>The butterfly in <a href="#Fig32_2">Fig. 2</a>
is very easily made, and
needs little explanation. Extend
the thumbs of both
hands, keeping the four
fingers of each bunched
together.</p>

<p>Then cross your hands
with the thumbs crooked in
one another, and the butterfly
will be ready to flit on
to the screen.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>To make the swan shown in <a href="#Fig32_3">Fig. 3</a>, both arms must be partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
bared and the right one bent upwards from the elbow. Extend the
third and fourth fingers
horizontally, bend the first
and second loosely upon
themselves and bring the
thumb to rest naturally
upon their tips. Hold
the left hand easily at the
crook of the elbow, as
shown in the figure, and
the swan is complete.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig32_4">Fig. 4</a> depicts a greyhound
ready to sprint. Extend the right hand thumb and close the
fingers together. With the

double the forefinger,
and bring the middle finger
down to touch the first finger
of the right hand.</p>

<p>By stretching down the
last three fingers of the right
hand, as shown in <a href="#Fig32_5">Fig. 5</a>, the
greyhound will be seen panting
as he races along, watched
by the old countryman depicted in <a href="#Fig32_6">Fig. 6</a>. The familiar household
pet is shown in <a href="#Fig32_7">Fig. 7</a> as she sits warming herself by the fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
<a href="#Fig32_7A">Figs. 7<span class="smcap">A</span></a> and
<a href="#Fig32_7B">7<span class="smcap">B</span></a> respectively suggest two other easily produced hand

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>When you have accustomed yourself to forming these figures quickly
and accurately, numberless other objects will present themselves to your
mind, and as the fingers grow supple the characters in your repertoire
will become more and more numerous and amusing.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig32_7B">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7<span class="smcap">b</span>.&mdash;The parson.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A few racy remarks about each shadow lend an interest to the
performance and serve to keep the spectators amused. Always be quite
sure of what you are going to do and how you are going to do it;
arrange your fingers quickly and correctly; do not keep the same figure
upon the screen too long, and you are sure to succeed.</p>

<p>A mistake is fatal, as nothing is more dreary for the visitors than
to watch you bungling with your fingers&mdash;uncertain how they should
be placed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Figure Shadows</span></h3>

<p>These are, perhaps, more entertaining than hand shadows, but
require much greater space, it being necessary to arrange them somewhat
after the manner of tableaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span></p>

<p>A white sheet must be drawn completely over one end of the room,
as S in <a href="#Fig32_8">Fig. 8</a>, whilst near the opposite wall three boxes of varying
height should be arranged as A B C in that figure, a candle being placed
upon the middle one.</p>

<p>There should be no other light in the room, upon either side of the
screen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig32_8">

<img src="images/illo254.png" alt="" width="600" height="344" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Arrangement of screen for figure shadows.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>When the performer enters by the door D his shadow is thrown
upon the screen in a natural size, but as he retires from the screen
and approaches the candle, his shadow increases to enormous dimensions,
and very funny effects will be produced.</p>

<p>A couple of performers may have a fight, the one near the candle
apparently being of gigantic stature, whilst the other close to the screen
is of ordinary build.</p>

<p>With a little practice it can be so managed that the two figures,
although in reality at some distance from one another, appear to come
to blows, and the incongruity of their respective statures makes the
giant and dwarf fight of breathless excitement.</p>

<p>To add to the ridiculous situation, the giant can be given a knockout
blow by the dwarf. A very small man can be made to make love
to a huge woman, vainly endeavoring to reach her face in order to
imprint a kiss upon her colossal lips.</p>

<p>Another amusing picture is to show a figure with a very swollen
cheek. This illusion is best produced by tying a ball of worsted to
the face. The dentist then approaches with a pair of large tongs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
one hand and a carving knife in the other, opening and closing the
tongs with fierce relish. Grasping the patient firmly by the throat, he
extracts a large molar, made of cardboard stuck between the worsted
and the cheek. Then, brandishing aloft the cause of his client&#8217;s
trouble, he slices off the swollen part of the sufferer&#8217;s features, detaching
the worsted, and proudly exhibits patient and tooth to the
audience.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Disappearing Man</span></h3>

<p>A surprising effect to be obtained in these figure shadows is the
total disappearance through the ceiling of one of the actors. This is
very simply done by stepping upon the lowest box (C), striding over
(B) which bears the candle, and on to (A) which makes the shadow
appear to leap into the ceiling. Let a figure dressed as a policeman
rush upon the scene, hotly pursued by a sailor brandishing a stout
stick. The two chase each other about the stage for a time, and presently
the sailor shouts very fiercely, &#8220;Get off the earth with you&mdash;get
off!&#8221; and makes a savage rush at the policeman, who, casting one
terrified glance over his shoulder, steps over the candle, and literally
&#8220;gets off the earth.&#8221; The sailor then bursts into a roar of laughter,
dances a hornpipe, and retires.</p>

<p>During all these tableaux a running patter should be kept up, which,
combined with the fantastic doings upon the screen, cannot fail to keep
the spectators in fits of laughter. Figure shadows are certainly the
most amusing of any Shadow Shows, and are so easily done that fear
of failure need deter no one from undertaking them.</p>

<p>Almost any play can be adapted to Shadow Shows; nursery rhymes,
burlesques of well-known tragedies, purely farcical buffoonery&mdash;none
will come amiss so long as there is plenty of action, whilst success is
assured if all the actors concerned keep the ball rolling.</p>

<p>At the close of the entertainment, when the last piece has been
finished, let one of the figures appear upon the screen and <span class="nowrap">repeat&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This will please the grown-up members of your audience who have

disappear into the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Puppet Shadow Shows</span></h3>

<p>To work a Puppet Shadow Show is more difficult than either of
the preceding entertainments, and requires considerable skill and ingenuity
to present satisfactorily. As the name implies, the shadows in
this case are cast upon the screen by lay figures, and the performers,
of whom two are requisite, do not appear at all.</p>

<p>The simplest way to make a &#8220;stage&#8221; upon which to exhibit your
puppets is to stretch a strong piece of cord across the corner of a
room, and hang therefrom a sheet
which shall reach from one wall to
the other. Some people prefer to
stretch it across an open doorway,
but this is largely a matter of convenience,
and is not always possible.</p>

<p>Before fastening up the sheet
mark upon it a rectangle, as shown
in <a href="#Fig32_9">Fig. 9</a>, the rectangle being five
feet from the bottom, two feet high,
and four feet wide.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig32_9">

<img src="images/illo256.png" alt="" width="350" height="348" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;Diagram of screen for puppet show.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Now take pieces of thick brown
paper and tack them over the remaining
portions of the sheet, so
that when completed it shall be
entirely opaque, except for the rectangle or stage upon which your
figures are to perform. The brown paper will, of course, be on the
side hidden from the audience. The next thing to be considered is
the lamp, which should have a tin reflector and a one-inch burner.
Arrange it in such a manner that it shall hang in the center of the
stage and some eighteen inches or two feet from the screen&mdash;indeed
at just sufficient distance to allow you to manipulate your figures without
coming into collision with the light.</p>

<p>If possible shut out all light except that which is thrown by the
lamp upon the stage, as the darker the room the more effective will be
the appearance of the shadows. Take great care the sheet is so firmly
fixed that it neither flaps nor creases.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this, turn to the making of the puppets.</p>

<p>The best material from which to manufacture them is thin zinc or
tin, waste scraps of which any tinsmith will gladly sell for a mere trifle.
With a pair of shears the metal can be readily cut to any shape, whilst
it will also be strong enough to bear the rivets for working the figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span></p>

<p>The puppets should be about six inches in height. This is the best
way to make them. Draw the figure selected upon
a piece of fairly thin white paper, taking care to
accentuate all prominent points and features. Paste
the figure&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> a crossing-sweeper&mdash;upon a piece of
tin, and carefully cut the outline with the shears as
in <a href="#Fig32_10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>Of course the puppets must be as comical as you can imagine, and
should be neatly and accurately
outlined. Notice that the figure
has no arm, as this must
be movable, and should be made
separately, thus: draw the limb,
holding a broom as in <a href="#Fig32_11">Fig. 11</a>,
cutting it out in the same way
as you have done the body.</p>

<p>Now take a punch and
make a hole in the body at the
shoulder, whilst two holes must
also be made in the arm, as
at A and B in <a href="#Fig32_11">Fig. 11</a>. Get
five cents&#8217; worth of quarter-inch
iron rivets, and place one
in the hole B of the arm. Make a loop in a piece of No. 9 size<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
wire and place it over this rivet in the arm. Next bend the rivet with
a pair of pliers, and fasten the wire as shown in <a href="#Fig32_12">Fig. 12</a>. Put a rivet
through A in the corresponding holes in body and arm, and bend the
rivet head over as before. Your crossing-sweeper is now complete.</p>

<p>By pulling the wire, which should run down one leg, and thus be
invisible to the spectators, the arm can be raised or lowered from below,
and the figure will appear to be sweeping vigorously.</p>

<p>Upon this plan every other puppet may be constructed, making as
many joints in a similar fashion as are required.</p>

from cardboard, as in <a href="#Fig32_16">Fig. 16</a>, whilst a very good effect can be obtained
from a windmill with movable sails (<a href="#Fig32_17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

upon the piece you desire to represent.</p>

<p>Supposing it is your intention to exhibit three separate plays in
the course of the entertainment, three different sets of figures will be
required. The younger members of an audience are quick to observe
any repetition.</p>

<p>The figures are made so easily and cheaply that it will be quite as
well to have a complete set for each play.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Manipulating the Puppets</span></h3>

<p>The following hints should be borne in mind when manipulating
the puppets. Keep all the figures ready for immediate use; lay them
upon a table in the order in which they will be required, and remember
where they are so that you can put your hand upon them the moment
they are wanted. Keep your own head and fingers well out of sight&mdash;the
whole effect will be spoiled if the spectators see a great black finger
pulling some wire or adjusting a refractory limb. Keep as calm and
collected as possible.</p>

<p>If some part of a figure sticks and refuses to move, tell the audience,
in an amusing piece of patter, that Jim, or whatever his name may<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
be, has had a sudden stroke of paralysis, and must be carried away to
the hospital.</p>

<p>When there is a hitch&mdash;and this will occur even with a professional&mdash;pass
it off with a rattle of bantering fun, making the audience imagine
it to be part of the show.</p>

<p>As the puppets are made from thin metal be careful never to turn
them round upon the stage. March the figures off the scene with
some quaint excuse, and introduce them again facing in the direction
you desire.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay too much stress upon the absolute necessity
for the showman&#8217;s being ready with all kinds of patter. Funny as the
scenes may be made with the figures alone, they are quite unentertaining
unless all their doings can be explained with an unceasing tongue.</p>

<p>From the moment your first figure appears upon the scene, until
the last one has made its exit, a continuous flow of amusing dialogue
and comment should keep the audience on tenter-hooks of surprise
and excitement&mdash;shrieking with laughter over absurd remarks or in an
agony of wonder as to what will happen next. Dull and stupid as
patter may appear upon paper, it should certainly be written down
and well studied before beginning the show, for impromptu fun cannot
be relied upon.</p>

<p>A lot of extempore humor can be introduced when you yourself
have entered into the spirit of the show&mdash;but it is imperative that
regular patter should be learned by heart. Nothing can be more tiresome
than a halting conversation of which one party has forgotten
the cues, whilst the other cannot remember the lines.</p>

<p>If you can sing, intersperse a song or two here and there when
there seems a suitable occasion, but be rather sparing than otherwise
with your music.</p>

<p>It may also be borne in mind that it is not necessary to have dialogue
the whole time. A clever and amusing description of what is being
done often proves better than a lengthy conversation in which the characters
explain themselves. A few crisp remarks are worth a bookful
of such speeches. However, when you are once fairly embarked on the
play, let your puppets joke and abuse one another as much as they
like.</p>

<p>To conclude with a few words as to what is suitable for the Puppet
Shadow Theater.</p>

<p>The great object of every entertainment is to be funny without
introducing vulgarity. The nature of the show necessitates fairly short
pieces, and experience has proved that several short and amusing plays
are more appreciated than one long piece, during the performance of
which interest is sure to flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span></p>

<p>Choose commonplace incidents of everyday life. An inventive mind
will soon adapt the ridiculous side of things to a screamingly
funny show. Do not attempt too much. With a smart patter, full
of current expressions and allusions to topics of the time, preferably
local, which all your audience can appreciate, the most casual events
become laughable.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the well-known family <span class="nowrap">trouble&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="smcap">Bridget</span>, the Maid.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="blankbefore75">With these five characters and a suitable amount of talking an
amusing sketch can be given. The following is a mild suggestion of
what can be done, but you will find that it can be made very much
funnier when actually performed.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>, <i>a House</i> (<a href="#Fig32_16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<div class="theplumber">

<p><i>Mrs. Hoggins emerges, loudly complaining that a pipe has burst
and spoiled her nice new carpet. She blames everybody in the
neighborhood, not omitting Mr. Hoggins, who is in town. &#8220;Just
like a man: never here when he is wanted.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>She calls Bridget, and tells her to run for the plumber. Bridget
seems unable to understand. &#8220;Sure, Mum, and the grocer came
this mornin&#8217; and ye didn&#8217;t want any fruit!&#8221; Mrs. Hoggins then
explains matters with considerable volubility, and Bridget departs.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Plapper rushes out, waving his arm, and complaining that
his house will be ruined by the overflowing water. The drawing-room
ceiling has already come down. He sees Mrs. Hoggins, and
asks her heatedly what she means by it. That lady replies suitably,
and they wrangle until the plumber comes, when Mr. Plapper
retires with a few sarcastic remarks.</i></p>

<p><i>Jim, the plumber, listens to Mrs. Hoggins&#8217; explanation, and
disappears into the house to see what he can do, only to reappear
in a moment, remarking that he must go home to fetch his hammer.
He accordingly leaves the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Plapper returns with a policeman, relating matters so excitedly
that Robert is not quite sure whether it is a case of fire or merely
a murder. He enters the house, and Plapper abuses the plumber,
who, returning at this moment, thoroughly enters into the spirit of
the fray.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span></p>

<p><i>He also goes into the house, but comes out immediately, having
suddenly remembered that it is time to go to dinner.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hoggins appears upon the scene once more, and encounters
Plapper, who asks: &#8220;Well, Ma&#8217;am, and what have you done about
it?&#8221; &#8220;Done? If you would do something, instead of standing
there talking like a monkey, perhaps we should know where we are.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>In an interval of the conversation a loud sound of kissing is
heard, and Mrs. Hoggins demands what it is. &#8220;Water oozing
through my ceiling,&#8221; says Plapper. Mrs. Hoggins laughs satirically
and retires. She apparently finds Robert making love to Bridget,
for he suddenly appears running out of the house very hurriedly,
followed by the fiery remarks of Mrs. Hoggins. He is making a
few rejoinders when Jim, the plumber, returns just in time to say
that his wife is expecting him home to afternoon tea. A general
chorus of excited abuse is then heard, in which Mr. Plapper joins
from the background. So Jim walks away, saying that he will cut
all the water off, leaving them nothing to drink, let alone wash in,
until next day.</i></p>

</div><!--theplumber-->

<p>This may seem very poor fun, but when staged and supplemented
with good strong patter it should be most amusing. Opportunities
always arise for introducing smart remarks and witty rejoinders, which
cannot fail to &#8220;bring the house down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Complete sets of figures, with the various plays for which they are
intended, can be purchased from all good shops making a specialty of
entertainment requisites, but it is more interesting to make everything
for oneself; and the prospective shadow showman may feel assured
that, with care and patience, he will be able to give a performance that,
costing but a dollar or two, will prove quite as entertaining as one purchased
at many times the sum.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXIII</b><br />
LIGHTNING CARTOONS AND &#8220;FAKE&#8221; SKETCHING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Novel Form of Drawing-Room Entertainment</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> exhibition of skill which cannot fail to win appreciation from any
audience, particularly one composed largely of grown-ups, is that of
making lightning cartoons and sketches. It is, however, a form of
entertainment which should be undertaken only by those possessing
some artistic qualifications. Although lightning cartoons do not call
for any great genius, yet those with an
inherent taste for caricaturing will find
themselves the best exponents of the
work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the task may
be undertaken by any youth with even
a moderate knowledge of drawing, because
by the observation of the few
rules hereafter indicated, quite passable
and pleasing results may be obtained.
The apparatus required is simple and
easy to procure. The first essential is
a cheap easel, which can be purchased
for fifty cents from any art store. To
give it a presentable appearance for a
drawing-room entertainment, it should
be stained with any oak or mahogany
composition. Those who possess a bent
for carpentering will perhaps prefer to
make their own easel. It can be made from 2 inch battening. First
cut two pieces to the required height, and glue or mortise together with
two stays, A and B (<a href="#Fig33_1">Fig. 1</a>). Drill holes for the reception of pegs at
CC. A further length, D, will also be needed for the back stay, hinged
at E. F shows a section of the hinging.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig33_1">

<img src="images/illo263.png" alt="" width="350" height="457" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Easel for lightning cartoons.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The next requisite is a large drawing-board. Half-a-dozen large<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
sheets of cheap cartridge paper should also be procured. These latter
may be fixed to the drawing-board by nails driven firmly into the top
right- and left-hand corners in such a manner that each sheet can
easily be removed after it has been drawn upon. The media employed
for plain black-and-white drawings are thick sticks of charcoal or soft
crayon.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that as lightning sketching permits of
no erasures, each subject must be thoroughly committed to memory
before a public demonstration on the paper is attempted.</p>

<p>The best subjects for a beginner to attempt in black chalk or
crayon are caricatures of celebrities, those selected all possessing some
particularly marked or prominent feature, <i>e.g.</i> the late Mr. Gladstone,
with his remarkable forehead, striking nose, and the characteristic high
collar.</p>

<p>Idiosyncrasies of well-known people should also be seized upon;
for instance, the eyeglass and orchid so universally associated with
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. It will be found that if these peculiarities
are properly portrayed and accentuated, but very few strokes of the
crayon will suffice to produce an unmistakable likeness. The budding
cartoonist should also bear in mind that boldness of execution is
essential, the strokes being put to paper with free and large sweeps of
the hand.</p>

<p>The subjects intended to be drawn must be selected beforehand,
the order of their appearance also being prearranged.</p>

<p>To obtain the correct mental picture of each character or subject,
it is at first recommended to attempt only heads. Let the young cartoonist
first procure a pronouncedly good photograph, in profile preferably,
and copy this in detail, gradually omitting half tones or shadings
until the likeness is apparent when only the minimum of strokes is
used. As soon as the ability to do this has been thoroughly acquired,
the outlines should be drawn again and again until the hand has become
so accustomed to the correct presentation of the portrait that it can
draw it off in a second or two. The lightning cartoonist must live up
to his reputation for speed.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Now, to treat with the order in which the various features and
leading characteristics are to be drawn in. A start is generally made
with the curve above the nose, taking the stroke down and round
to the nostril (A, in <a href="#Fig33_2">Fig. 2</a>); then the upper lip, mouth, and chin (B),
if possible, without breaking the line. Next take the chalk and draw
the crown of head and curve of forehead, beginning at the right-hand
top of head, presuming the face to be in profile to the left. With a
sweeping stroke draw in either the outline of the hair or bald head,
coming back to the forehead and finishing at the point from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
start was made (C, <a href="#Fig33_2">Fig. 2</a>). Now, leaving the outline of the face,
return to the point at which the curve for the hair or head was
started, and bring round another bold sweep down into the nape of<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
the neck (A, <a href="#Fig33_3">Fig. 3</a>). Shading may be put in according to judgment.
The eye must next receive attention, afterwards the ear, and, lastly,
the collar or any other distinguishing mark.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Simultaneous Drawing</span></h3>

<p>A welcome variation to the above is produced by a brief exhibition
of simultaneous drawing with both hands. The best method of procedure
is to take a piece of chalk in each hand, and, bringing them
together in the middle of the top of the drawing (A, in <a href="#Fig33_6">Fig. 6</a>), take
each hand round and down, the right hand drawing the profile, the
left the back of the head, and so complete the picture by working off
the lines respectively on the right side with collar and tie, and on the
left with the neck and back of coat. In <a href="#Fig33_6">Fig. 6</a> the dots show the other
lines necessary to complete the effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig33_6">

<img src="images/illo266.png" alt="" width="450" height="343" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Simultaneous drawing with both hands.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Figured Face</span></h3>

<p>Another diversion may be caused by drawing at lightning speed
a figured face. How this is to be accomplished is not at first
apparent when you sketch in to all intents and purposes at random
a few detached numerals, such as appear in <a href="#Fig33_7">Fig. 7</a>; but the addition
of extra figures produces the very expressive countenance depicted in
<a href="#Fig33_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span></p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>A deal of fun may also be extracted from outline representations
of an egg. Commence by sketching in with quick strokes three or
four of these. Fill in the individual expression of each by such series
of lines as are suggested in <a href="#Fig33_9">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig33_10">10</a>, and as a climax
pin to each a suitable paper costume or fancy collar, frill, or tie, as
shown in <a href="#Fig33_11">Figs. 11</a> and <a href="#Fig33_12">12</a>. These latter aids to the equipment of the
lightning cartoonist must be prepared beforehand from colored tissue
paper, kept behind the easel, and instantaneously fixed on to the large
sheet of cartridge paper by means of pins. The effect will be both novel
and grotesque.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Smoke Pictures</span></h3>

<p>To produce wonderfully picturesque and striking examples of land
and seascapes in the space of a few moments of time appears at first
sight a task almost beyond the capabilities of the amateur draughtsman.
Yet such effective additions may be made to the programme of
the lightning cartoonist by his following out the subjoined simple instructions.</p>

<p>First procure a large sheet of iron or tin, enameled white. To
purchase this in a prepared state is rather expensive, but a very fair
substitute can be made by coating the tin or iron with ordinary white
enamel.</p>

<p>Smoke the enamel surface to a uniform blackness by passing
it backwards and forwards over an ordinary small hand-lamp, the glass
chimney of which has been removed. Fix the black sheet to the easel,
either resting it on a wooden rack or across the pegs.</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span></p>

<p>Before commencing on the actual drawing, memorize a suitable
subject, such as a stretch of water gleaming under the moon, with
light reflections, as in <a href="#Fig33_13">Fig. 13</a>. The effect of the finished picture
may now be obtained
by wiping out the
black so that the
white enamel shows
through and forms
the lights. The removal
of the black
may be accomplished
either with the fingers
or by means of a soft
piece of rag. In view
of the fact that the
fingers form a better
medium for drawing
than does the rag the
use of the former is
recommended, but as
the cartoonist may
have arranged to follow this part of his entertainment with other
drawings on white paper, he would do well, while dealing with the
smoked surface to cover
his finger-tips with stalls
cut from old kid gloves.
These can be discarded
without the necessity for
a break in the performance,
as would be the case
were the fingers blackened
in the process. <a href="#Fig33_14">Fig.

<p>Yet another variation
in lightning cartooning is
provided by the ability of the artist to produce pictures which, when
turned upside down, show exactly the same view. These are best
done in colored chalk or pastel, which is a softer medium and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>

<p>Yet a further pleasing addition to the entertainment may be made
by sketching such a scene as <a href="#Fig33_16">Fig. 16</a> suggests, afterwards over-coloring
with white the part representing
the sea, and also the jutting
rock marked A up to the dotted line;
then turning the whole picture on end,

<h3><span class="smcap">Shadow Drawings</span></h3>

<p>A very interesting entertainment is
to be brought to a close by a short
exhibition of shadow drawing. The
apparatus required is a magic lantern,
before the lens of which is fixed a prepared
plate consisting of glass previously
covered with a coating of lamp-black
and water. A sheet of calico should be attached, some distance
away, to the wall. Between the plate and the lantern, and a little to one
side, stands the operator, who with the aid of a stick or stump sketches
the subject upon the plate, the light filtering through throwing an
enlarged presentment of the picture upon the calico screen.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXIV</b><br />
FRICTIONAL FUN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Amusing Electrical Experiments</span><a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Electricity</span> may be said to have a finger in most pies. From its manifestations
it would appear to be an all-pervading force, and modern
research tends always to substantiate this conclusion. Thus two coins&mdash;a
cent and a quarter&mdash;cannot be brought into contact without producing
their quotum of electrical force, and in like manner the principles
of its working may often be demonstrated by the simplest apparatus.</p>

<p>There are two states which this subtle force assumes, called Static
and Dynamic. The former word indicates a condition of rest, and is
applied to electricity when stored in suitable magazines ready for discharge
at a favorable opportunity, just as water may be held in lofty
reservoirs, ready to pour down and perform work&mdash;whether useful or
otherwise&mdash;if the pipes be opened. Dynamic, on the other hand, indicates
a state of motion; so that Dynamic Electricity means that it
is flowing along conductors from one place, where there is a large
quantity of the force, to another less powerful, in the same way as&mdash;again
using the comparison with water&mdash;the latter pours along connecting
pipes from a high level to a lower. Phenomena of static electricity
are invariably produced by friction, and some experiments of
this class will be first described.</p>

<p>The chief element of success in friction electrical experiments is
a warm and dry atmosphere. The operations should therefore be conducted
in a well-ventilated room where the fire has been burning some
time, whilst all apparatus may with advantage have stood warming for
some time before.</p>

<p>1. Rub a 6-inch square of brown paper with a warm silk handkerchief,
then place flat against the wall or marble fireplace. It should
cleave tightly to either of the latter surfaces.</p>

<p>2. Again electrify the brown paper and hold it above any willing
person&#8217;s head of hair. The locks will fly up towards the paper and
appear like bristles. You may then make sure of a safe retreat, and
utter side remarks about &#8220;wire.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span></p>

<p>3. Sprint smartly after the cat, which, like the other apparatus,
should have been warming itself on the hearthrug, and having effected
a capture, stroke the fur backwards. If the hand be not moist, considerable
sparking should occur and be easily visible in a darkened
room.</p>

<p>4. By combing dry hair quickly with a warm ebonite comb, and
then applying this to the knuckles, distinct sparks may often be
obtained.</p>

<p>5. Cut a piece of paper into small confetti, and place near it a
stick of sealing-wax or ebonite rod, which has been rubbed with flannel.
The paper atoms are attracted to the rod through a distance of one
inch or more, and then, contact having once occurred, they immediately
drop off.</p>

<p>6. In the previous experiment it was found that the paper atoms
having once touched the rod, dropped off directly. This behavior was
caused by a sequence of happenings.</p>

<p>First the negatively excited sealing-wax caused positive charges to
possess the upper surface of the paper&mdash;the equal negative charges
being driven downwards&mdash;so that, the two kinds of electric energy
having a mutual affinity, the paper sprang towards the wax. Immediately
they touched, however, the positive charges of the paper were
neutralized by the large excess of negative energy from the sealing-wax,
and then, since electricities of like sign exercise mutual repulsion,
the negative paper was driven from the negative wax.</p>

<p>Now this repulsion of similarly charged particles is demonstrable
by a straightforward experiment, whose simplicity of description is
in nowise proportionate to its entertainment. In truth, it consists merely
of blowing a soap-bubble and catching it upon an excited stick of glass
or wax. The bubble becomes electrified, its myriads of particles repel
one another, and the beautiful globe expands in size, possibly to breaking
point.</p>

<p>7. Scratch any design or word upon a small sheet of indiarubber&mdash;such
as is used in the manufacture of mats&mdash;and then dust over the
surface a thoroughly-shaken mixture of red-lead and sulphur. When
all excess of the powder has been blown away, the design should
appear in grains of red-lead, showing to excellent effect on the gray
rubber ground.</p>

<p>8. By the following method a spark of sufficient intensity to light
house gas may be obtained from brown paper. Support a salver on
four well-dried inverted tumblers, placing a rubber ring between the
tray and each glass, and twist a copper wire round a spoon which
rests on the tray. The other end of this wire must be held&mdash;insulated
from the fingers by a piece of indiarubber or by the ordinary covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
of the wire&mdash;just over the gas-jet, whilst about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch away is held
another piece in metallic connection with the hand; that is, in reality,
<i>via</i> the operator&#8217;s body with the earth.</p>

<p>Now, if the gas be turned on slightly and a piece of warm brown
paper, electrified by stroking vigorously with a dry brush, be placed
on the salver, a spark should pass across the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch gap and ignite
the escaping gas.
If the spark does
not pass at once,
approach the wire
extremities slightly
closer together.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig34_1">

<img src="images/illo274.png" alt="" width="400" height="362" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Raising paper by touching wooden lath with electrified
sealing-wax.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>9. The following
experiment
owes its origin to
Gray&mdash;an early
worker in the field
of static electricity:
Erect two dry
tumblers with a
piece of waxed
cardboard between,
after the
fashion shown in
<a href="#Fig34_1">Fig. 1</a>, and lay a
lath on the top
glass. Beneath
one end of the
lath spread small pieces of paper, over an ebonite or wood surface
supported on another inverted glass. Then if a stick of sealing-wax,
which has been vigorously rubbed with flannel, be approached to the
other end of the lath, the particles of paper will fly backwards and forwards
between the lath and the ebonite surface&mdash;on which they would
normally rest.</p>

<p>10. A simple trick, but one nevertheless causing considerable
amusement to spectators, may be arranged in the following manner:
Bore a hole carefully at the middle of a wooden meat skewer
(A, <a href="#Fig34_2">Fig. 2</a>), of such size as to take a bone knitting-needle tightly
(B, <a href="#Fig34_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Sharpen the blunt end of the skewer and mount it so as to turn
easily between bearings erected on inverted wine-glasses. These
may consist of two wood blocks (C, <a href="#Fig34_2">Fig. 2</a>), in each of which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
shallow conical hole is made to receive the points of the skewer. On
these stand weights (E, <a href="#Fig34_2">Fig. 2</a>) to keep wood-bearings firm. When
this is in position and swings easily, adjust the needle until it balances
exactly. It should be at right angles to the skewer, and may be fixed
in position, if necessary, with glue or sealing-wax.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig34_2">

<img src="images/illo275.png" alt="" width="400" height="305" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The balanced disc.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Now cut two discs of white paper (D, <a href="#Fig34_2">Fig. 2</a>) of a diameter about
1 inch less than the knitting-needle&#8217;s length, and, having printed across
one the word &#8220;DONE&#8221; in
large type, glue them&mdash;centers
at the point where
the needle and skewer intersect&mdash;on
either side of
this cross. Erect the apparatus
as shown, so that
the needle stands vertical,
with the blank paper disc
facing the audience, and
then invite the latter to see
if they can effect a movement
without either touching
or blowing the disc
or creating any disturbance
whatever. The conditions should preclude any person, except the
canny operator, from attaining success. He, however, innocently
takes a postcard (previously warmed and dried), tears it sharply in
half, and presents one ragged edge to the projecting bone needle.
The cardboard became electrified by tearing, and should exercise quite
enough attraction on the needle to upset its nice balance, whereupon
the other disc becomes visible, together with its notice &#8220;DONE.&#8221;
The audience may take the ambiguous meaning according to their
pleasure.</p>

<p>Few further experiments can be performed without the use of
special apparatus. So far, we have dealt only with the most minute
quantities of electricity, and if more striking effects are to be produced,
our stores of energy must be increased.</p>

<p>Fortunately instruments of a fairly wide application may be rudely
constructed at home, although, naturally, results must not be looked
for comparable to those obtained with perfected apparatus. However,
brief directions now follow for the manufacture of such simple instruments,
and so, as commencement, let us appropriate two 3-lb. jam pots
from which Leyden jars are to be evolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig34_3">

<img src="images/illo276a.png" alt="" width="250" height="394" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Leyden jar.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Leyden Jars</span></h3>

<p>Procure as much metal foil as possible, either by raiding the
nursery or by purchasing some tinfoil-wrapped
butter scotch at the confectioner&#8217;s, and gum it round
the jam jars so as to extend about half-way up the
outside (A, <a href="#Fig34_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>Next solder stiff brass wires (8 inches long)
to two round pieces of metal, so cut as to pass
the jar mouths readily. To the other end of one
brass rod solder another disc of metal, tin&mdash;or,
better, brass&mdash;nicely smoothed along its two edges
by sandpaper. The other brass rod may be looped
at its end and have tinfoil wrapped round until a
respectable knob be formed, or else have a brass
bedstead globe soldered on.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The electroscope.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>These brass standards are then stood inside,
with their metal bases resting on the bottom of the
jars and surrounded by lead shot to the same
height as that of the tinfoil, without. The finished article should
appear something like the sketch shown as <a href="#Fig34_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gold Leaf Electroscope</span></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Electroscope parts.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Obtain a square glass pickle or preserve jar, to the mouth of which
has been fitted a large cork bung (A, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>). Next
take a 7-inch length of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch brass wire (B, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig.
4</a>) (similar to that used for the Leyden jars above),
and flatten one end by hammering (F, <a href="#Fig34_5">Fig. 5</a>), after
having bent it triangular-shape, as in (C, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>A 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch length of cycle valve-tubing (A, <a href="#Fig34_5">Fig.
5</a>)  is to be slipped over the brass rod B (<a href="#Fig34_5">Fig. 5</a>), and
then strips of gummed brown paper, 2 inches wide,
lapped round and round the rubber-tubing until a
paper cylinder some <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch across the outside is
formed (C, <a href="#Fig34_5">Fig. 5</a>). Anyway, this paper cylinder
must be a good fit for a hole bored through the
center of cork (D, <a href="#Fig34_5">Fig. 5</a>), into which, moreover, it
must be glued when dry. The stopper, paper, &amp;c.,
must then be allowed to soak in hot candle wax for
an hour or so, wiped clean and put aside to cool.
Excess of grease must be particularly removed&mdash;with
paraffin if necessary&mdash;from the plain end of the metal rod, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
which we must next solder a brass knob (D, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>) or, as an alternative,
tinfoil may be twisted round a loop in the wire until a ball is
formed, as in the case of the Leyden jar.</p>

<p>The next operation is to cut two strips of Dutch metal&mdash;or, better,
gold leaf&mdash;size <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch by 2 inches, and gum them on either side of
the flattened brass rod triangle (E, <a href="#Fig34_4">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig34_5">5</a>). This is best
managed by laying the brass, after being lightly gummed, upon the
Dutch metal strips in the correct position,
and when fixed trimming off the corners of
the leaves close to the sides of the triangle&mdash;not,
of course, at the base, or no strips
will remain to hang down. Dutch metal
and beaten gold are both employed in gilding,
and should be obtainable in small quantities
at any picture-framer&#8217;s shop.</p>

<p>If the cork be now fixed in the mouth
of the jar and the brass rod adjusted so
that the gold leaves hang free of the interior,
our electroscope is practically complete.
However, a few pieces of calcium
chloride, or pumice stone soaked in strong
sulphuric acid, may be included at the bottom
of the jar (F, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>), in order to
absorb moisture; and lastly, as a brass ball
is not always the most satisfactory terminal
for this instrument, one other small accessory
may be made. This consists of a 2-inch
circle of tin, or, preferably, brass (G,
<a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>), exactly like that fitted to one of the Leyden jars, and to the
under side of which is soldered a ring of springy brass (H, <a href="#Fig34_4">Fig. 4</a>)
about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch deep, so made as to fit securely on the brass ball terminal.
Thus the metal table is adaptable to the brass knob, whenever such an
arrangement is required.</p>

<div class="figright w200" id="Fig34_6">

<img src="images/illo278a.png" alt="" width="200" height="336" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;The electrophorus.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Electrophorus</span></h3>

<p>Our Leyden jars have been constructed to store electrical energy,
and the gold leaf electroscope to indicate its presence. But we do not
yet possess the means of producing this energy in any considerable
quantity.</p>

<p>To make an instrument for this purpose proceed as follows: Clean
the inner surface of a circular tin lid&mdash;diameter 6 inches or 7 inches,
and about <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch deep&mdash;(A, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>), and in the center stand upright
on its head a brass screw, whose point has been filed down until it<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
<i>nearly</i> reaches to the level of the upper edge of the lid (B, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>).
Then carefully pour in melted lead or zinc to a depth of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch. This
process is not absolutely necessary, but is advisable if the metal be
available and the extra trouble is not distasteful.</p>

<p>When this metal has thoroughly cooled, melt
up sufficient rough resin to just overflow the tin,
pour it in and allow to solidify properly without
the least disturbance (D, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>For the upper part of the electrophorus, take
a disc of tin or brass, absolutely flat, and of
the same diameter as the resin surface (E, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig.
6</a>). In the center of its upper side solder a
short piece of brass tube (F, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>), the correct
internal width to fit tightly on a 12-inch length
of polished wood rod, cut, say, from a walking-stick
(G, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The drawing shows the general arrangement
of this electrophorus, wherewith, by the help
of a piece of fur, electricity may be generated.
A small cavity must be made in the resin, just
above the screw (H, <a href="#Fig34_6">Fig. 6</a>), so that the point of the latter may be
clearly seen.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig34_7">

<img src="images/illo278b.png" alt="" width="200" height="191" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;The discharger.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Discharger</span></h3>

<p>One last piece of apparatus&mdash;the simplest in construction&mdash;remains
to be made. Bend a piece of stout brass wire into a semicircle (A,
<a href="#Fig34_7">Fig. 7</a>); then, having flattened it at the
middle, pass through a hole at the end of
a wooden handle (B, <a href="#Fig34_7">Fig. 7</a>), and fix in
position by means of a tiny glued wedge
(C, <a href="#Fig34_7">Fig. 7</a>). Next twist the rod at both
ends into loops, and wrap tinfoil round so
as to form metal knobs (D, <a href="#Fig34_7">Fig. 7</a>). Brass
balls may be used instead. This arrangement
is now complete, and we may commence
experimenting.</p>

<p id="Ref7">11. Twist a stout piece of copper wire
surmounted by a brass or tinfoil ball round
the outside coating of a Leyden jar (A, <a href="#Fig34_8">Fig. 8</a>), so that the two knobs
are about 3 inches apart. Suspend a pith ball (B, <a href="#Fig34_8">Fig. 8</a>), made from
dried wood pith, by silk thread (C, <a href="#Fig34_8">Fig. 8</a>) from some support above,
so that it hangs normally midway between the two knobs.</p>

<p>Next excite the resin surface of the electrophorus by rubbing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
a dry rabbit&#8217;s fur, muff, or flannel; and, holding the cover of this
instrument by the handle&#8217;s extreme end, place it upon the resin. Remove
immediately and bring near to the knob, which connects with
the interior of the Leyden condenser,
at the same time touching
its outer tinfoil surface with
the finger. A spark should pass
between the electrophorus cover
and the Leyden jar, whereupon,
if the former and finger be removed,
and the pith ball allowed
to drop into position, this will
oscillate violently to and fro between
the knobs.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>12. Construct a Leyden jar
with knob terminal similar to
that previously described, but
cover part way up the outside
with gold paint (A, <a href="#Fig34_9">Fig. 9</a>), instead
of tinfoil. Charge this
condenser by means of the
electrophorus cover, as described in <a href="#Ref7">experiment 11</a>, and if sufficient
induction does not take place with one contact, replace the metal
disc on the resin and pass a spark to the Leyden condenser knob
several times, taking care to touch
the gold paint coating with the
finger on each occasion. If now
the semicircular discharger, held
by the wood handle, be brought
so that one knob touches that of
the Leyden condenser whilst the
other moves over the gold-paint
surface, long series of sparks, differing
greatly in appearance from
any previously produced, will pass
between the gilt and the discharger.</p>

<p>13. Excite a stick of sealing-wax
by rubbing with flannel, and
bring it against a pith ball suspended
by silk. The sealing-wax was negatively charged, and the
pith ball is now in a like condition. To prove this, approach the
flannel which excited the wax, and had consequently acquired a positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
charge; inasmuch as the pith ball is immediately attracted and we know
that positively excited bodies have an affinity for those negatively affected,
the pith ball must be of the latter character.</p>

<p>If, further, a glass rod be excited by rubbing with silk and brought
near to the negative pith ball, the latter will again be attracted, showing
the glass to be positively charged.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the silk rubber repels a pith ball which has
been in contact with excited sealing-wax, in the same way as it will
repel the latter substance
itself if suspended freely,
thus indicating that the
silk is similarly, <i>i.e.</i> negatively
charged.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of
positive and negative electricity
may be somewhat
differently demonstrated
by means of the electroscope.
Touch the terminal
of this instrument
with rubbed sealing-wax.
The gold leaves diverge.
Moreover, they may be
thrown farther asunder
by bringing the electrophorus resin near, so that evidently the charge of
this instrument is also negative. Perhaps as a diversion it may be
noted that resin is one of the chief ingredients of sealing-wax. The
electroscope leaves remain apart even when the electrified body has
been removed, but they may be made to collapse by touching the knob
with the finger or bringing an excited glass rod near. The former
action &#8220;earths&#8221; (<i>i.e.</i> connects, <i>via</i> the person&#8217;s body, with the house
walls and the earth) the gold leaves and allows the electrical charge
to escape, whilst the latter operation counteracts the negative charge
by virtue of the positively excited glass.</p>

<p>14. If the electrophorus and electroscope be placed as shown in
<a href="#Fig34_10">Fig. 10</a>, the gold leaves being already held asunder by a negative
charge from sealing-wax, and the cover of the first instrument be lifted,
whilst a strip of cardboard bridges from its upper surface to the disc
terminal of the electroscope (A, <a href="#Fig34_10">Fig. 10</a>), the instrument&#8217;s leaves will
fall together again. From this behavior it may be gathered that the
charge on the upper surface of the electrophorus cover is positive,
or opposite in character to that induced by rubbing on the resin
cake.</p>

<p>15. Stand a charged Leyden jar and the electroscope close together
on the table. They must not be so near, however, that the gold leaves
are affected by the condenser&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>If, now, a few pieces of sulphur, spread upon the Leyden jar&#8217;s
disc terminal, be ignited so as to burn freely, the gold leaves will
immediately diverge slightly, indicating that part of the electric charge,
which is being rapidly dissipated by way of the flame into the atmosphere,
has traced a path to the electroscope.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;The swinging mannikin.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>16. An amusing variation of <a href="#Ref7">experiment 11</a>, wherein a pith ball
was rendered restless between the two terminals of a Leyden condenser,
is constituted by
carefully modeling a little
seated figure out of pith
and sealing-wax. The
mannikin is threaded on
a silk strand, so that the
legs hang down as though
seated on a swing, and is
then suspended by tying
the two silk ends to a support
above. <a href="#Fig34_11">Fig. 11</a> indicates
the arrangements.</p>

<p>Two Leyden jars are
next required, of opposite
influences. To effect this,
charge one by the ordinary
method of touching
its terminal several times
with an electrophorus cover, being careful on each occasion to &#8220;earth&#8221;
the outer surface, whilst the other condenser is charged by presenting
its <i>outer</i> surface to the electrophorus cover, and each time touching
the knob terminal with the finger, <i>i.e.</i> &#8220;earthing&#8221; it.</p>

<p>By this method, whilst the charge at the knob of one Leyden jar
is positive, that at the terminal of the other is negative. Place these
two instruments at equal distances on either side of the &#8220;swing&#8221;
support, and at such an elevation that the pith figure may just touch
the brass knobs.</p>

<p>Then, if the swing be started going, it should continue to oscillate
for a considerable time. As the pith figure approaches, say, the positive
knob, it acquires a negative charge and is thereby attracted.
Directly it touches, however, this negative state is counteracted, a
positive charge supersedes it, and repulsion between pith figure and
positive knob ensues. The pith doll then swings over towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span>
negative knob and&mdash;being positively influenced&mdash;is of course attracted
until contact takes place. Then negative supersedes positive in the
pith figure, repulsion again results, and a similar cycle of changes is
repeated. Thus the figure continues to oscillate until the charges of
the jars have been exhausted or have leaked away.</p>

<p>17. In the same manner as the alternate attraction and repulsion
of a light body has been used to maintain oscillation, so similarly an
electrostatic motor may be constructed embodying the same principles.
Cut out a 16-pointed star of cardboard, 8-inch diameter, and, having
glued a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch slice of cork in the middle of each side (A, <a href="#Fig34_12">Fig. 12</a>),
pass a knitting-needle through the star&#8217;s center at right angles (B, <a href="#Fig34_12">Fig.
12</a>). Both ends of this spindle
rest in conical cavities (C, <a href="#Fig34_12">Fig.
12</a>), which may be punched
or drilled in small brass discs
to act as bearings, and the apparatus
is mounted as shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig34_12">

<img src="images/illo282.png" alt="" width="450" height="402" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;Electrostatic motor.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is important that the
cardboard should be perfectly
dry, and with this end in view
it may well have previously
received a saturation in paraffin
wax. When set hard, stick a
brass pin bent at right angles
into each point of the star, and
set Leyden jars of different
charges beneath any two diametrically
opposite points.
The motor, being given a start, should continue to revolve for some
time owing to the succeeding attraction and repulsion of the metal
pins.</p>

<p>The following description is of a small machine which may be
fairly easily constructed, and when in good working order will give far
better results than the electrophorus. <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a> shows the reference
letters and general arrangement. Two cork bungs (A, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>), previously
saturated with paraffin wax or shellac varnish, are fixed into
the ends of a cylindrical lamp chimney, and through a hole in the exact
center of each passes a wooden rod (B, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>), which must be glued
in place. Each end is supported in a wooden bearing (C, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>),
black lead being used as a lubricant, and to the protruding one a small
handle (D, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>) is fitted, wherewith the glass may be revolved.
Next a long pad of wash leather (E, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>), stuffed with horse-hair,
is fixed so as to press gently against the cylinder, whilst a silk flap<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
(F, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>) about 2 inches wide hangs over the top surface of the
glass. A brass chain (G, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>) is also fixed to the wash-leather
cushion and, in the ordinary way, connects to &#8220;earth&#8221; either direct or
through the operator. The wash-leather cushion is well black-leaded
where it touches the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig34_13">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;Frictional machine (more useful than the electrophorus
for producing electric charges).</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>On the opposite side of the cylinder a metal comb (H, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>) is
supported, the teeth being <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-inch away from the glass, whilst the
back of the comb is soldered to a brass knob (I, <a href="#Fig34_13">Fig. 13</a>) fixed on a
wood pedestal. Any noticeable edges at the base of the brass globe
should be filed off until
only round surfaces are
presented.</p>

<p>Care should be taken
to dry the machine
thoroughly, and if then
the handle be turned
regularly, as indicated
by the arrow, the brass
knob should rapidly become
charged to such
an extent that sparks
may be drawn with the
knuckles, possibly with
discomforting results!</p>

<p>If the brass ball possess any sharp edges or, alternatively, if a
length of wire girdle it so that one end projects radially about one
inch, then the electricity will leak from these extremities in the form
of a glow discharge as fast as it is developed. This frequently creates
such a disturbance in the surrounding air as to distinctly blow a candle
flame when held at the discharging point.</p>

<p>In 1752 Faraday invented an arrangement of attraction and repulsion
by which three bells were kept ringing. To the electrical machine
conductor was attached a metal support from the ends of which hung
two bell domes on brass chains, whilst from the center another was
supported by a silk strand and connected by a brass chain to earth.
Between the bells small brass clappers were hung by silk threads, as
shown in <a href="#Fig34_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>The action in working was for the machine to charge its conductor
and hence the two outer bell domes, which then attracted their brass
clappers until contact took place. This caused repulsion, so that the
clappers swung over to the center dome, where discharge to earth
ensued and a condition obtained when the cycle of events might be
repeated.</p>

<p>Having thus arrived, <i>via</i> the simplest phenomena, at a piece of
mechanism which will work, our experiments in the field of static
electricity must conclude; but rather, let it be noted, on account
of a dearth of apparatus than from
any scarcity of phenomena to be
studied. If therefore the reader foresees
an opportunity of pursuing the
subject further, such for example as
the use of a well-equipped laboratory,
let him not hesitate to snatch
the advantage. To mention two facts
demonstrable by further experiment:
(1) Frictional electricity is produced
in excessively small quantities at a
very high pressure. For this reason
sparks in air may be produced frictionally
of such a length as cannot be
obtained direct from batteries. (2)
Friction itself is not a necessary element in the production of electrical
energy, but is adopted in order to bring every portion of the rubbed
surfaces into perfect contact. Thus far and no further. We must say
&#8220;Au revoir,&#8221; and splash down a full stop.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXV</b><br />
SOME ELECTRICAL EFFECTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic of Mystery</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A phenomenon</span> is always mysterious, so long as its origin remains
hidden. That is to say that any event, the causes of whose manifestation
are obscure, will be found to prompt some feeling of wonderment.</p>

<p>For this reason then&mdash;just as an automobile in motion will bewilder
a savage, because he has at no time seen any but living creatures moving,
and does not understand the new mechanism&mdash;so for us an electrical
effect mostly presents something of a miraculous nature. To
take a concrete example. Whereas the ringing of a church bell by the
sexton engenders no feeling of wonderment in the average listener&#8217;s
breast, the buzzing of an electric bell, which ensues upon connecting
with a battery, does have this influence to a greater or less extent,
because the electricity&#8217;s behavior is by no means so obvious as that of
the sexton pulling the rope.</p>

<p>Let this character of the miraculous then, which pertains with
scarcely an exception to every electrical phenomenon, stand as an excuse
for the experiments to be detailed hereafter.</p>

<p>Electricity may be produced by a variety of methods. For commercial
purposes, where unstinted supplies are necessary, mechanical
energy is converted into the subtle force by means of dynamos. Exceptional
sources of mechanical energy are now frequently used, as
witness the Niagara Falls, where electric current is produced on the
site, and whence it is conducted by cables to places of utility; and also
the case of Nansen&#8217;s &#8220;Farthest North&#8221; Expedition (before Cook found
the Pole!), which utilized a deck windmill for installation of electric
light aboard.</p>

<p>Electricity is also produced when any two substances are brought
into contact, and more especially if they are placed near one another,
but not touching, in certain liquids, thereby forming &#8220;cells.&#8221; With
these arrangements, electricity finds its source in chemical action; and,
although not powerful, such cells are extensively employed, on account
of reliability, in telephone and telegraph systems. No more convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
source of galvanic energy has yet been devised than a battery of &#8220;cells&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
a number of cells connected together&mdash;and the type which we
intend to use, and of whose construction the following is a description,
is among the cheapest possible to make and maintain.</p>

<p>The battery is to consist of eight cells, connected together, in a
manner hereafter described. For each cell procure a 1 lb. stone jar
(A), and line it inside with a sheet of tin (B), which may be cut
from a condensed milk can, and should be curved so as to press outwards
against the jar&#8217;s inner surface (<a href="#Fig35_1">Fig. 1</a>). A 2-inch length of
copper wire (C) is soldered to its upper edge.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The next operation is to twist an 8-inch piece of copper wire for
about 6 inches of its length round a pencil, thus forming a spiral (X),
round which a flannel bag (A) filled with small coke (B) is tied (<a href="#Fig35_2">Fig.
2</a>). At least two thicknesses of flannel are advantageous, or if this be
found rather expensive, flannel and rag combined, or odd pieces of rag
alone may be utilized.</p>

<p>The chief considerations are to construct a porous wall of appreciable
thickness round the coke, and to avoid colored rags if possible. The
bag is to stand upright in the middle of the jar, leaving about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch
space all round to be packed with zinc scrap, which for convenience
may well be &#8220;granulated.&#8221; To make this, melt up as much waste zinc
as can be collected in a ladle and pour it in a thin stream into a large
bowl of cold water, moving the ladle over the surface of the water
meanwhile, in order to cool the zinc stream as suddenly as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
The zinc which forms in a heap at the bottom of the bowl should be
breakable into very small pieces, and is termed &#8220;granulated&#8221; (<a href="#Fig35_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>When the cell has thus been assembled with curved tin sheet, bag
of coke and broken zinc in place, it is nearly filled with strong salt
solution, and above this,
in order to prevent evaporation,
a thin layer of
melted tallow may well
be poured. <a href="#Fig35_4">Fig. 4</a> represents

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The eight components of the battery being thus complete, nothing
necessary remains but to connect
them together. However,
they will prove more portable
and self contained if arranged
in a shallow wood tray. This
may be either a confectionery
box&mdash;if one of suitable dimensions
is obtainable&mdash;or can
perhaps be constructed as indicated
by the accompanying sketch, with handles at either end
(<a href="#Fig35_5">Fig. 5</a>). It should certainly be strong, as the set
of jars is of considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
weight, and would, if accidentally dropped, create a pretty
printers&#8217; pi. Lastly, when the cells have been arranged in two rows
of four a side, the finishing
touch is to join the copper
wire ends by twisting, according
to the plan shown
in <a href="#Fig35_6">Fig. 6</a>, and the battery is
complete. The end wires
A and B will be referred
to hereafter as negative and
positive terminals respectively.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Experiment 1.</i>&mdash;Connect one extremity of a straight wire with the
battery&#8217;s positive terminal, and place it on the table so as to lie
due north and south.
Above it stand a compass,
whose needle&mdash;also
pointing due north
and south&mdash;will be
parallel to the wire
(<a href="#Fig35_7">Fig. 7</a>). Now, when
the free end of the
north-south conductor
is connected to the
battery&#8217;s other terminal so that a current may flow, the needle swings
round at right angles and thus now lies east and west. Needless to
add, electricity prompts the
needle&#8217;s behavior, and unless
such movement does
take place, the cells are at
fault somewhere.</p>

decided by the compass&#8217;s
behavior that the battery is

obtain a spare bobbin from
an old electric bell (<a href="#Fig35_9">Fig. 9</a>),
and pass the current round the coils whilst making the spark. This
should now be more distinct&mdash;thicker, and brighter, though not so
frequent&mdash;owing to induction taking place between the wire coils.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 3.</i>&mdash;Repeat the previous <a href="#Ref8">experiment</a> whilst using pieces
of carbon, round which the free wire ends (D and E, <a href="#Fig35_9">Fig. 9</a>) are
twisted, to bring into contact with one another (<a href="#Fig35_10">Fig. 10</a>). The spark
obtained is very bright, and
may possibly by careful handling
be maintained for a moment
or two; if the current is
more powerful, the spark does
keep constant, even though
the carbons be drawn apart
considerably, and thus forms in principle such an arc lamp as floods
the streets of towns with their dazzling rays. The pieces of carbon
may frequently be picked up beneath arc light standards, after the
electrician has gone
on his rounds &#8220;trimming&#8221;
the lamps.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 5.</i>&mdash;If a few iron filings (A, <a href="#Fig35_12">Fig. 12</a>) be scattered evenly
on a sheet of paper (C, <a href="#Fig35_12">Fig. 12</a>) and a horse-shoe
magnet (B, <a href="#Fig35_12">Fig. 12</a>) approached from
beneath, the filings arrange themselves in a
curious design, which really maps out the
magnetic lines of force. Now, if this experiment
is repeated whilst using the bell-bobbin
in place of the permanent horse-shoe magnet,
and a current passed round the coils, the same
disposition of the filings ensues, showing that
the bobbin&#8217;s iron cores have been magnetized.
In <a href="#Fig35_13">Fig. 13</a>, A is the filings; B, the wire from
negative terminal battery; C, the sheet of paper; and D, the wire from
positive terminal.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 6.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Flax&#8221; wire, whose core consists of about forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
fine copper filaments stranded together, may often be had in scrap
lengths at electricians&#8217; shops, as it finds wide employment in lighting
installations. The silk and rubber insulation should be ignited and
allowed to burn, any
residue being carefully
wiped off with
rag, after which two
lengths of, say, three
strands apiece are
separated from the
wire core. These
are very flexible, so
that when attached
to the battery terminals
and magnet
wires the bobbin,
being extended as shown by a silk strand, is able to revolve freely in
any direction. As a matter of fact, whilst the current is flowing the
bobbin sets itself north and south like any other magnet&mdash;a very
ordinary performance, the reader may remark! But, on the other
hand, if the flexible wires be changed over so that the one previously
connected to the battery&#8217;s positive
terminal is now connected to the
negative and <i>vice versa</i>, with the result
that the current travels round
the bobbin coils in an opposite direction,
the electro-magnet swings half
a turn, and comes to rest with its
pole that was towards the north
now pointing south. So that the
bobbin resembles a weathercock,
except in so far as it changes with
the current instead of the wind
(<a href="#Fig35_14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

small brass standards,
for which straightened
curtain-rod clips may
well be employed, are
screwed about 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches apart to a wooden baseboard, and have a
hole drilled near their top edges to accommodate the spindle (B, <a href="#Fig35_16">Figs.
16</a> and <a href="#Fig35_17">17</a>). This
being placed in position,
should be provided
near the bearings
with washers
(E, <a href="#Fig35_17">Fig. 17</a>) and
beads (D, <a href="#Fig35_17">Fig. 17</a>),
the washers being
soldered in order
to prevent lateral
movement of the
shaft. Lastly, with
a view to realistic
appearance, solder a small tin fan (C, <a href="#Fig35_17">Fig. 17</a>) to one projecting end
of the spindle, and enamel or paint it gray. The arrangements of these
fittings are made quite clear by the diagram.</p>

<p>By now the most difficult part of our task has been attempted, so
that if the reel and spindle revolve &#8220;sweetly&#8221; in the bearings, no
doubt need be entertained as to
whether the motor will ever reach
completion.</p>

<p>The bell-bobbin must be mounted
with its magnet faces as near the reel
circumference as possible, and with
their centers the same height above
the baseboard as the spindle. A piece
of wood beneath the bobbin, of such
thickness as to keep it at the right
height, and another strip across the
top, through the ends of both of
which screws are driven into the baseboard,
will secure the magnet firmly
in position (<a href="#Fig35_18">Fig. 18</a>). The next operation is to bend a springy strip
of brass to the shape shown in F, <a href="#Fig35_19">Fig. 19</a>, and fix it immovably
by the screw G&mdash;round which one free end of the bobbin wire (L)
has been twisted several turns&mdash;to the baseboard, so that its top
portion misses the metal square or contact-breaker (P) on the spindle
by about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch. Now drive a second screw (R) carefully into the
wood through another
hole in the strip, until
this latter presses
lightly against each
point of the contact-breaker
successively as
the spindle revolves.</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

<p>The little motor is
now complete, except,
perhaps, for the addition
of two terminal
screws, one of which
is joined with the remaining
free bobbin
wire, and the other by
a short length of wire
to either of the bearings. The entire connections are shown in the
accompanying sketch (<a href="#Fig35_20">Fig. 20</a>). Now for working! Connect the battery
wires to the motor terminals, and adjust the spindle so that one
corner of the contact-breaker is fairly touching the vertical brass
strip. A current should now be flowing round the bobbins, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
consequently become magnetized and attract the nearest iron nail fastened
to the thread reel. If the iron is not sufficiently near to be under
the magnet&#8217;s influence, turn the reel <i>on the shaft</i> until it is in the proper
position. The motor, with a little adjustment, ought to run merrily,
as the bell-bobbin&mdash;alternately magnetized and demagnetized&mdash;attracts
and releases the short iron bars.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 8.</i>&mdash;Connect the battery terminals together by means
of some thin iron wire such as is used for wiring flowers, and twist
it into a spiral so that it may rest comfortably in a cup of cold water
(A, <a href="#Fig35_21">Fig. 21</a>). Stand also therein a thermometer (B, <a href="#Fig35_21">Fig. 21</a>). The
water&#8217;s temperature will be observed to rise steadily, showing that the
passage of the electric current heats the iron wire (C, <a href="#Fig35_21">Fig. 21</a>), which
in turn imparts some warmth to the surrounding liquid.</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p><i>Experiment 9.</i>&mdash;The previous experiment showed that an electric
current heats a material through which it passes. If the thin iron
wire be shortened to a length of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch, our battery will probably
bring it to red-heat, thus demonstrating the principle of electric incandescent
lamps. The difference between theory and practice, however,
in this case consists in the use of carbon, or, very rarely, platinum, in
place of the iron filament, and of inclosing this in a glass bulb free of
air, so that combustion cannot proceed rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 10.</i>&mdash;Immerse two wires from the battery terminals at
some little distance apart in a glass of water, which has been <i>slightly</i>
soured with sulphuric acid or spirits of salt. The weak acid readily
conducts the electric current, which decomposes the water into its<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
chemical constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, the former gas coming
off in bubbles at the wire which leads from the battery tins, and the
oxygen round the other conductor (<a href="#Fig35_22">Fig. 22</a>). The hydrogen bubbles
may perhaps be ignited as they are evolved by holding a lighted match
just near the water&#8217;s surface; or another method is to seal the wires
into separate glass tubes, so that both dip beneath the water, and light
the hydrogen gas as it escapes from the tube&#8217;s upper end (<a href="#Fig35_23">Fig. 23</a>).
In this case great care must be taken to allow time for the expulsion
of all air from the tube, because hydrogen and air in certain proportions
form a very explosive mixture.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 11.</i>&mdash;Repeat the foregoing experiment, using copper
sulphate solution in place of the acidified water. After the current
has passed for some time, one of the wires will be noticed to have
become thicker whilst the diameter of the other has decreased. This
behavior is owing to deposit of copper from the solution on the one
conductor and abstraction of metal from the other, whose bulk diminishes
in automatically maintaining the solution&#8217;s strength (<a href="#Fig32_24">Fig. 24</a>).
In this reaction is seen the basis of commercial electroplating&mdash;silver
and nickel solutions being mostly employed instead of the copper bath,
since these are the metals with which those of a baser nature are more
frequently plated.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 12.</i>&mdash;Electrotyping is a modification of electro-plating,
where a mold of wax coated with some conducting substance like graphite
is used to deposit the metal upon. Melt some quantity of sealing-wax<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
on to a piece of cardboard, so that it spreads out slightly
larger in diameter than a fifty-cent piece, and when just plastic press
the &#8220;head&#8221; surface of the new coin into the wax, so that an exact
replica is obtained. Fasten a copper wire by some extra wax to the
cardboard disc (as in <a href="#Fig32_25">Fig. 25</a>), and carefully cover the whole matrix
with powdered blacklead,
working it well into the
crevices and up to the
copper conductor, with a
camel-hair brush. Hang
this in a jar containing
saturated copper sulphate
solution&mdash;the copper wire
being connected to the
negative battery terminals
(A, <a href="#Fig32_26">Fig. 26</a>), whilst a
sheet of copper or coil of wire is suspended in the solution some little
distance from the sealing-wax mold, with a wire connecting to the other
battery terminal (B, <a href="#Fig32_26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p>So long as the current continues flowing a reddish deposit will
form on the blacklead surface, and if
the action be allowed to continue until
a fair thickness of metal is secured,
the wax may be carefully melted off,
leaving an exact relief of a fifty-cent
piece&#8217;s reverse side in a copper. Any
medal or seal may be used in place of
the silver piece to obtain a first mold,
but the coin has been mentioned as being
probably the most suitable article
near at hand.</p>

<p>With this example of electrotyping,
our series of descriptions must terminate.
But the embryo scientist, who
has traveled thus far, need not cast his
apparatus to the winds and henceforward
forsake electrical matters. He
may arrange various combinations of
wines and liquids&mdash;such, for example,
as passing the current through water to his motor, and noting the
decrease in speed, or insert various lengths of iron wire in the circuit.
Possibly the batteries will betray exhaustion, and they may then be
reinstated by discarding the old salt solution, rinsing and replenishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
the granulated zinc, and washing the flannel bags in permanganate of
potash solution. These batteries are, in fact, a real asset, as they can
be used&mdash;three or four together&mdash;in setting up an electric-bell installation,
and are easily replenishable, when at length their life begins to
ebb.</p>

<p>An endless fund of amusement&mdash;less expensive and more instructive
than many&mdash;awaits those who explore the realms of the pygmy lightning
spark.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXVI</b><br />
SAFE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Amusing Tricks with Simple Apparatus</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> many boys and girls who have acquired at school some knowledge
of Science, the mere mention of the words &#8220;Scientific Experiments&#8221;
recalls memories of experiments far from amusing, for the science of
the laboratory is more often than not accompanied by some of the
innumerable little worries of school life.</p>

<p>When, however, experiments are conducted at leisure in the home,
the work assumes a totally different aspect, and much pleasure may be
derived from it.</p>

<p>Not only may such experiments become a source of great amusement,
but they are of considerable educational value, since it is from
the study of the most elementary scientific laws that some of the greatest
discoveries of modern science have been made.</p>

<p>The aim of this chapter is, then, to place before you a series of
interesting and instructive experiments which may be performed for
the amusement of yourselves and friends on occasions when outdoor
recreation is impossible.</p>

<p>In selecting these experiments, endeavors have been made wherever
possible to mention only home-made apparatus, or such requisites as
are easily procurable at very slight cost.</p>

<p>Of what, then, do these amusing experiments consist?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Piercing a Coin with a Needle</span></h3>

<p>The first is one which, at a casual glance, seems impossible to
perform.</p>

<p>To pierce a copper coin with a needle, especially if the needle is thin,
seems, indeed, a tremendous task. It is, however, very simple.</p>

<p>The apparatus necessary consists of a cork, a needle, and a
hammer.</p>

<p>Stick the needle through the cork in such a manner that the point
only just protrudes, and, with a pair of pincers, cut off the head of
the needle remaining above the cork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span></p>

<p>Then, having placed the coin and cork as shown in the diagram,
hit the cork vigorously with the hammer (<a href="#Fig36_1">Fig. 1</a>). The needle being
unable to bend in
any direction owing to
the cork keeping it
rigid, will pierce the
coin quite easily, since
we know that the steel
of which the needle
is composed is harder
than the copper of the
coin.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Match Trick</span></h3>

<p>Another very interesting
experiment is
that performed with
an ordinary match, a bottle, and a coin.</p>

<div class="figright w150" id="Fig36_3">

<img src="images/illo298c.png" alt="" width="150" height="234" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Coin leaving
match and
dropping into the
bottle.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Bend in two an ordinary large match, thus partly breaking it, in
such a manner that the two parts hold together by a few fibers of
wood.</p>

<p>Place it, thus broken, on the neck of a bottle, and
then on the match place a dime or any other small
coin.</p>

<p>Having done this ask a friend if he can make the
coin fall into the bottle without touching the coin, the
bottle, or the match. You will find that he will search
in vain for a solution to this seemingly
impossible task, which however may
be overcome in a very simple manner,
as may now be seen.</p>

<p>Dip your finger in a glass of water,
and placing it above the angle formed
by the match, allow one or two drops
of the liquid to fall on this angle
(<a href="#Fig36_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Immediately the fibers of wood,
swollen by the moisture, try to
straighten themselves, and you will
see the angle of the match increase
little by little until the match no longer supports the coin, which then
drops into the bottle (<a href="#Fig36_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Tricolor Glass</span></h3>

<p>Most of us, if not all, know that if wine is carefully poured on
water, it floats on the surface, but not every one knows how to place
the wine at the bottom of the glass with the water above it, and this
without mixing the two liquids. For this experiment make use of the
different densities of hot and cold water.</p>

<p>Take an ordinary glass (moistened first with hot water to prevent
its cracking) and pour some boiling water into it.</p>

<p>Then by means of a funnel placed almost to the bottom of the
glass, pour in some wine which has previously been cooled by ice. By
working carefully you will see the wine form in a red layer at the
bottom of the glass (<a href="#Fig36_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Now gently remove the funnel, and pour on the surface a bluish
liquid lighter than water (for instance, alcohol colored with ink)
(<a href="#Fig36_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>You will now have a layer of blue on top, thus completing the
tricolor glass, which will by the aid of a light project the three colors
of the flag on the wall. The tricolor glass may also be used for illumination
purposes.</p>

<p>To make it represent fireworks is even more entertaining.</p>

<p>If you allow the water in the glass to cool by placing it in a vessel
containing cold water, the wine will rise from the bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
glass in the form of thin threads, strongly resembling rockets
(<a href="#Fig36_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The different liquids mix, and the descending columns of blue, mixed
with the ascending columns of red, produce a curious spectacle like that
of fireworks in a glass of water.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Changing Water into Wine</span></h3>

<p>This is not a reproduction of the miracle performed at the wedding
feast of Cana, but it is, nevertheless, a most interesting experiment.</p>

<p>Fill two tumblers (A), or wine glasses, of equal diameter, with
water, by completely immersing them in a basin of that liquid, standing
one upright and the other upside down upon it. When they are both
completely full, with not a bubble of air in either, join their rims and
remove them from the basin. Now place them upright on a dish,
and, if their rims fit accurately upon each other, the water will remain
in them. It is now necessary to place on the top of the upper glass
a third glass, (B), containing wine, or better still, spirits of wine in
which is dissolved a little aniline dye.</p>

<p>Now announce to your friends that without touching any of the
glasses, you will, before the eyes of the audience, cause the wine to
pass from the glass (B) into the upper (A) glass without a drop entering
the lower (A) glass.</p>

<p>In order to perform this amazing experiment take a strip of wool
or cotton, moisten it with the liquid contained in the top glass (B),
and hang it over the edge of this glass with one end completely immersed
in the liquid.</p>

<p>This forms an excellent siphon, for it allows the liquid in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
top glass (B) to flow away in drops which fall on and run down the
glass underneath until they reach the junction of the rims. Here
they are drawn in by capillary attraction, and, the wine being lighter
than the water, they rise to the top of the upturned glass (A), displacing
the water contained therein by causing it to flow out between the rims,
after which it collects in the dish
below.</p>

<p>This action will go on until
the top glass (B) is empty, when
the whole of its contents will
find their way into the upturned
glass, whilst the lower one (A)
remains perfectly clear (<a href="#Fig36_7">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Eruption of Vesuvius</span></h3>

<p>Many of us, no doubt, have
often tried to picture to ourselves
a volcano in eruption, but
most will confess that unless we
have seen some very good pictures
of an actual eruption, we
are not at all certain that our
self-made picture is correct.</p>

<p>Now to detail an experiment
which gives a vivid idea of a
volcano in action.</p>

<p>At the bottom of a large glass
bowl put a flask containing red
wine, or spirits of wine, in which
has been dissolved a little aniline
(B, <a href="#Fig36_8">Fig. 8</a>). This flask should
be closed by a cork pierced with
a very narrow hole. By the aid of plaster, or, simpler still, of earth
or clay, fashion a mountain around the flask, leaving at the top a hole
through which the cork can just be seen. This will form the crater.</p>

<p>Having made your volcano, fill the bowl with water (A, <a href="#Fig36_8">Fig. 8</a>),
and you will now witness the eruption.</p>

<p>We know that, owing to the difference in the density of the two
liquids, the water will penetrate into the flask, thus displacing the wine,
which escapes in a thin red column. As this column nears the surface,
it will spread out, thus resembling a cloud of fiery smoke as seen
issuing from a volcano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span></p>

<p>Care must be taken to shake the water, in order that the streak of
color may represent in as realistic a manner as possible the reddish
smoke of a volcano disturbed by the wind.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;A peculiar
candlestick.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Peculiar Candlestick</span></h3>

<p>Water supporting a lighted candle seems a very peculiar form of
candlestick; and yet despite this it will be found
quite as serviceable as any other.</p>

<p>To make the candlestick is quite easy. All
you have to do is first to weight the end of a
piece of candle (previously used) with a nail or
piece of metal, in such a manner that, when
placed in a vessel of water, the liquid will be
flush with the edge of the candle without wetting
the wick.</p>

<p>Next light the candle, and announce that,
in spite of the unfavorable surroundings, your
candle will burn to the end.</p>

<p>This may at first seem extraordinary, but
a little reflection will show that your statement
is correct, for this experiment is only a striking
example of the Law of Archimedes, which
states that &#8220;when a body is immersed in water,
it loses in weight an amount equal to the weight of the water displaced.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span></p>

<p>Now, whilst the candle is being consumed it is becoming shorter,
but, on account of its diminution in weight, it rises in the water at the
same rate at which it is consumed (<a href="#Fig36_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making a Paper Fish Swim</span></h3>

<p>The title of this experiment suggests something rather wonderful,
indeed, for it seems impossible to impart motion to a paper fish.</p>

<p>It may be done, however, and quite easily, as will be seen from the
following.</p>

<p>From a piece of ordinary paper cut out a fish like that shown in
the <a href="#Fig36_11">diagram</a>, and of the size of an ordinary fish. In the center make
a circular hole (A),
communicating with
the tail by a narrow
canal. (A B) (<a href="#Fig36_11">Fig.
11</a>). Having done
this, fill an elongated
vessel with water, and
place the fish on the
surface of the liquid
in such a manner that
the underneath face is completely moistened, while the other remains
quite dry.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>You are now ready to set the fish in motion; but to add to the interest
of the experiment, challenge any of your friends to make the fish move
without touching or even blowing upon it.</p>

<p>This may seem to them impossible. This is how it is performed.</p>

<p>With great care pour one large drop of oil into the opening (A);
the oil at once tries to spread over the surface of the liquid, but that
is only possible if it escapes by the narrow passage (A B).</p>

<p>This it does, and owing to the reaction the fish is thrust in<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
the direction opposite to the flowing of the oil&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it will be thrust
forward, the movement lasting long enough for the spectators to view
with astonishment the unusual sight of a paper fish swimming
(<a href="#Fig36_12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Floating Pins and Needles</span></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;The floating pin.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If a drop of water is placed on glass it will at once spread, but if
the same thing is done with a drop of mercury, the liquid will not
spread, but remain in the form of a bead.</p>

<p>These two different results are due to the fact, that whilst the
water wets the glass the mercury does not.</p>

<p>Now take a pin which has been well dried; it is a body which
water will moisten, but owing to its very
smooth surface, not so easily as in the case of
glass.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, that by some means or
other you can place the pin so gently on
the surface of the liquid that the water does
not make it wet, you will notice that the water
takes on either side of the pin a convex shape,
and in this way a sufficient volume of water
is displaced to allow the pin to float as if it
were a match.</p>

<p>The experiment may, of course, be as
easily performed with a needle; nor must it
be thought it is confined to pins and needles
which are thin, for, with care, you may even
succeed with big darning-needles.</p>

<p>It has not yet been shown, however, how to place the pin on the
water in such a manner that it is not made even wet.</p>

<p>There are several ways of doing this, some requiring considerable
practice.</p>

<p>The following is the simplest.</p>

<p>Float on the surface of the water a cigarette paper; place the pin
upon it; leave the paper to sink to the bottom when it has become soaked,
and the pin will float without any difficulty, for on either side of the
pin the water takes the convex shape before mentioned, thus displacing
sufficient water to allow the pin to float.</p>

<p>In order to hide from the spectators the stratagem you have
employed, gently remove the paper before showing them the floating
pin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Joined by Air</span></h3>

<p>The <a href="#Fig36_14">picture</a> below is not taken from a prospectus advertising cement
for joining glass and porcelain, but is simply used to show how atmospheric
pressure may be utilized for joining glasses and plates.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this it is necessary to form a vacuum, but
as an air-pump is not at the disposal of every boy a partial vacuum
must suffice.</p>

<p>To obtain this partial vacuum suspend a glass from the ceiling, or
any other suitable place, by means of a string, and under it burn
a piece of paper. This will
cause the air it contains to
expand. Immediately afterwards
place the plate over
the mouth of the glass, and
it will adhere quite firmly.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the
entrance of any external air,
and thus destroy the vacuum,
the edges of the glass may
be smeared with tallow.</p>

<p>Now, how is it that the
glass and plate are so easily
fixed? Well, directly the hot
air contained in the glass comes in contact with the cold surface of
the plate, the air contracts, and as the plate prevents the entrance of
any more air, a partial vacuum is formed within the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig36_14">

<img src="images/illo305.png" alt="" width="450" height="328" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;Joined by air.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>As the atmospheric pressure is much greater than the pressure from
within, the plate remains firmly fixed to the glass (<a href="#Fig36_14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Glass Raising Extraordinary</span></h3>

<p>This experiment, similar in principle to the last, is quite as striking
in its effect.</p>

<p>It consists of raising in air a glass filled with water, by causing it
to adhere to the hand when the latter is held quite open.</p>

<p>With the last experiment fresh in our minds, it is not difficult to
guess that this phenomenon is due to the existence of a partial vacuum
under the hand, but it is not so easy to know how to obtain this
vacuum.</p>

<p>The means of carrying out the experiments are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Put the glass filled with water on the table, and over the top place<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
the palm of the hand, taking care that the four fingers are bent almost
at right angles, as shown in the first of the accompanying figures
(<a href="#Fig36_15">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p>If, continuing to press the palm of the hand on the edge of the
glass, you raise the four fingers quickly, thus having the palm stretched
out, you will force out most of the air which is between your palm and
the surface of the water, and in this way you will produce under your
hand a partial vacuum. This vacuum will be sufficient to allow the
atmospheric pressure to overcome the weight of the glass and its contents;
thus a sucker is formed which allows the glass to remain attached
to the hand (<a href="#Fig36_16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Novel Glass Emptier</span></h3>

<p>If you are given a glass filled with water, and a bottle equally full,
and then asked to empty the glass by means of the bottle, and that
without emptying the bottle itself, you will imagine you have been set
a very difficult task indeed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig36_17">

<img src="images/illo306c.png" alt="" width="500" height="135" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 17.&mdash;The glass-emptying bottle.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>You will soon see, however, that the solution to this seemingly
difficult experiment is quite simple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span></p>

<p>First take a cork, and in it pierce two holes. Through these gently
push two straws, one being as long as the glass, the other considerably
longer (<a href="#Fig36_17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p>By means of a pellet of bread or wax close the opening of the shorter
straw, and push the cork into the bottle until the water gushes out
of the longer straw.</p>

<p>In order to empty the glass it is now only necessary to turn the
bottle upside down, in
such manner that the
little straw touches the
bottom of the glass.</p>

<p>Then, taking a pair
of scissors, cut this straw
very near the end which
is sealed.</p>

<p>Immediately the water
in the glass will flow out
by the long straw until
the glass is quite
empty, despite the fact
that the bottle has remained
full all the time
(<a href="#Fig36_18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>Now for a few words
of explanation, in order
to make clear the reason
for this unexpected action.</p>

<p>The two straws form
the two arms of a siphon,
and as they are full of
water it is not necessary
to remove any air from
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig36_18">

<img src="images/illo307.png" alt="" width="350" height="483" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;A novel glass-emptier.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>As the liquid flows out of the long straw, it tends to produce
in the bottle a vacuum. As a vacuum is contrary to nature, it is
immediately destroyed by the entrance of an equal quantity of water
from the little straw, for the atmospheric pressure exerted on the
water in the glass keeps this little straw continually full. In this
way all the water is drawn from the glass by the bottle filled with
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Striking Siphon Experiment</span></h3>

<p>A very pretty experiment with the siphon may be performed by
making use of the following simple apparatus: An ordinary glass; a
little water colored, say with aniline; a piece of rubber tubing about
an inch long, one end of which is cut obliquely, as shown in the <a href="#Fig36_19">diagram</a>;
together with a piece of glass tubing from
four to five feet long.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig36_19">

<img src="images/illo308.png" alt="" width="200" height="410" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 19.&mdash;A siphon experiment.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>This tubing may be obtained from almost
any druggist.</p>

<p>Prepare for your experiment by taking
the length of tubing and, with a gas flame,
drawing one end out to a point.</p>

<p>Having done this, bend the tube twice,
as shown in <a href="#Fig36_19">Fig. 19</a>, particular care being
taken to avoid any sharp angles. The bending
of this tubing is easily done by holding
it in a gas or spirit-lamp flame until the
flame is colored yellow. The glass is then
soft enough to be gently bent to the required
angle.</p>

<p>Over the end which is not pointed slip
the piece of india-rubber tubing, and then
place this end in the colored water.</p>

<p>By applying suction to the pointed end
of the tube with your mouth, the siphon may
be set in motion.</p>

<p>If now you so arrange the tube that the
oval opening is partly out of water, the
flowing liquid will draw in bubbles of air
which, passing alternately down the tube with the drops of colored
water, produce a very pretty result.</p>

<p>The shape and size of the air bubbles may be altered at any time
by raising or lowering the tube, and this will add to the effect of the
experiment.</p>

<p>The experiment may be again varied by removing the tube
from the liquid, and before lowering it again, allowing 10
or 12 inches of air to enter. This long bubble will be
seen to pass slowly down the tube until it arrives at the
small opening, when it will be expelled at a great rate. The
liquid following this bubble acquires the same velocity, and, arriving
at the point, is ejected with such force that it will rise to a height of
6 or 7 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Electric Fountain</span></h3>

<p>Most of you would like to make an electric fountain, especially when
you learn how simple and easily arranged is this striking experiment.
Your apparatus consists solely of a glass, a long india-rubber tube, with
two small glass tubes and a piece of sealing-wax (a stick of sulphur
or piece of vulcanite will do just as well).</p>

<p>Make a small nozzle by drawing out a length of bent glass tubing,
and, by means of a long piece of india-rubber piping, fix it to another
piece of bent glass
tubing. Place the
first piece of tubing
bent at two right
angles over the side
of a glass filled with
water, taking care
that the reservoir
thus formed is from
3 to 4 feet above the
nozzle (<a href="#Fig36_20">Fig. 20</a>).</p>

<p>When the fountain
is playing the
issuing jet of water
will be inclined to
one side.</p>

<p>Now to electrify
the fountain. Take
the piece of sealing-wax,
vulcanite, or
sulphur, and, after
seeing that both your hand and the material you hold are perfectly dry,
rub the sealing-wax on the sleeve of your coat.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig36_20">

<img src="images/illo309.png" alt="" width="350" height="343" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20.&mdash;An electric fountain.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If now you hold the sealing-wax opposite the stream of water, at a
distance of a few feet, a remarkable change will come over the cascades.
Instead of the water falling in scattering drops, these latter
will at once unite, and descend in a solid stream, whilst directly the
sealing-wax is removed the jet of water returns to its original form.
If the water be allowed to fall on a piece of stiff paper, a difference
in sound will be noticed according as the water falls in a stream or
in drops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Bottle Cannon</span></h3>

<p>Doubtless you would like to have at home the experience of firing
a cannon, of hearing a report loud enough to frighten nervous persons,
to see the shell fly as quick as lightning, and then to witness the recoil
of your home-made piece of artillery.</p>

<p>Your apparatus will be quite simple, for you must first take a strong
bottle, such as a vinegar, or better still, a champagne bottle, and fill it
a third full with water.</p>

<p>Next take a little carbonate of soda, and also some tartaric acid, both
of which may be obtained at any druggist&#8217;s, taking care to wrap them
in packets which will not be confused one with the other.</p>

<p>Dissolve the carbonate of soda in the water contained in the bottle,
at the same time placing the tartaric acid in a playing card rolled in the
form of a cylinder, one end of which should be filled with a plug of
blotting-paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig36_21">

<img src="images/illo310.png" alt="" width="450" height="267" />

<p class="caption" id="Ref9"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 21.&mdash;The bottle cannon.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Having accomplished this much to your satisfaction, suspend the
cartridge just made from the cork of the bottle by sticking in it a pin
to which is attached a thread, particular care being taken that the bottle
is standing upright on the table, and that the open end of the tube is the
upper one.</p>

<p>After having regulated the length of the thread so that the bottom
of the tube does not touch the liquid in the bottle, tightly fit the
cork in.</p>

<p>You now have your cannon charged, and all that remains to be done
is to fire it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span></p>

<p>This is done by laying the bottle horizontally on two pencils placed
parallel to one another, thus forming a gun-carriage. Immediately the
bottle is so placed, the water penetrates the tube, and dissolves the tartaric
acid. The carbonic acid gas which is immediately produced blows
out the cork with a violent explosion, whilst at the same time, owing
to the reaction, the bottle rolls back on the two pencils, in exact imitation
of the recoil of a piece of artillery (<a href="#Fig36_21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXVII</b><br />
SAFE CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Twentieth-Century &#8220;Black Art&#8221;</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we stand in the twentieth century and peer curiously down the
corridors of Time, we find at all periods a deep interest in chemical
phenomena.</p>

<p>From the age when wisdom devoted itself in vain to the discovery of
an elixir of life and a method of transmuting the base metals into gold,
to the present day, when scientists pursue their experiments with more
reasonable and far worthier hopes, chemistry appears never to have
suffered any dearth of devotees, despite the fact that in olden times
one had either to occupy a high position or be a man greatly daring
if the Black Art was to be followed without fear of molestation.</p>

<p>To-day matters are different, so that the junior chemist need only
anticipate interference from <i>materfamilias</i>&mdash;a truly excellent person,
who, however, invariably regards chemical concoctions with hostile
contempt.</p>

<p>The obstacles instanced in the previous paragraph being foreseen,
perhaps no better initiative can be taken than to conciliate the household
deities by the performance of some particular experiment which
has an obviously beneficial result. This might happily be the removal
of ink stains from white linen; and naturally, if no cloth happen to be
so disfigured, some arrangement must be made whereby the ink is
accidentally spilt!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments with Chlorine</span></h3>

<p>(1) <i>Apparatus.</i>&mdash;Erect a 4-oz. round-bottom flask about 8 inches
above the table (A, <a href="#Fig37_1">Fig. 1</a>), by clamping its neck in a wooden clip or
twisted stiff iron wire, and fastening this to a firm standard. Introduce
three or four tablespoonfuls of powdered manganese dioxide
(obtainable cheaply in qr. lbs. at most druggists&#8217;), and pour over this
spirits of salt until the flask is one-third full. Into the neck now fit
a cork provided with two circular holes, through one of which a
stem funnel passes, and into the other a glass tube fits tightly, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span>
bent at two right angles, as shown in <a href="#Fig37_1">Fig. 1</a>. The glass tube may be
readily bent by softening it first over a spirit lamp&mdash;the flame being
colored distinct yellow when the glass reaches a pliable state. Slide
a 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch disc of paper (B,
<a href="#Fig37_1">Fig. 1</a>) on the free limb of the
tube, and also soak several 4-inch
circles of cardboard in
water. These will make satisfactory
covers for the small
glass preserve jars, in which
the gas is to be collected.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig37_1">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Apparatus for chlorine experiments.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>(2) <i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;Place
one jar beneath the glass tube
so that the latter&#8217;s orifice
reaches nearly to the bottom,
and slide the paper disc down
until it covers the mouth of the
jar C. On warming the glass
flask gently with a spirit lamp
or, if available, Bunsen gas
flame, a greenish-yellow gas is
evolved, and gradually expels
the air from flask, tube, and
jar, until this latter is filled with heavy chlorine. The warming is then
interrupted whilst the one jar is removed, covered with a moist cardboard
disc, and replaced by another. The heating again proceeds,
and so on until each remaining jar is
successively filled.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Chlorine Experiments</i> (1).&mdash;Damp
an addressed envelope, received
through the post, by pressing between
sheets of wet blotting-paper,
and stand it in a jar of chlorine with
the cover replaced (A, <a href="#Fig37_2">Fig. 2</a>). The
writing ink address will soon begin
to fade and finally disappear, whilst
the postmark, which has been impressed
in indelible printing ink,
remains unaltered. This reaction shows that chlorine possesses the
valuable property of bleaching writing ink. It may be turned to account
in removing stains from cloth by wetting the spoiled material first and
then standing in a vessel containing the yellow gas (<a href="#Fig37_3">Fig. 3</a>). The
fabric must be quite damp, however, as bleaching only proceeds in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
presence of moisture. Coloring matters, other than black ink, are
readily removed by chlorine, as may be strikingly shown by steeping a
wet rose blossom or bunch of violets in a jar of the gas (<a href="#Fig37_4">Fig. 4</a>);
the flowers assume a transparent waxy appearance, that will puzzle any
spectator as to their real identity.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine Experiments</i> (2).&mdash;The energetic gas attacks many substances
spontaneously. If thin blotting-paper be soaked in turpentine,
drained, and dropped into a jar of chlorine, the oil takes fire at once,
burning rapidly amid smoky black fumes. Metals are attacked just
as readily as the inflammable oil of turpentine. Powdered antimony
metal or iron filings shaken into a jar of chlorine scintillate brilliantly
with the evolution of thick white fumes. Similarly Dutch metal
leaf, used for gilding cheap picture frames, ignites in the gas; a salt of
copper being precipitated to the bottom of the jar when the action has
ceased.</p>

<p><i>All dealings with chlorine should be conducted in a well ventilated&mdash;even
draughty&mdash;room, and care must be taken not to inhale the gas.</i> It
corrodes animal tissues just as eagerly as it attacks turpentine and
metals. The gas is very heavy, however, and is therefore the less difficult
to keep under control.</p>

<p><i>Niter Paper.</i>&mdash;Touch-paper burns quickly, surely, and without
flame. It is prepared by soaking thin tissue paper with a saturated
solution of saltpeter in weak vinegar, and when dry feels rough and
crisp to the touch. Moreover, it burns with a rather pleasant smell.
The advertisement scheme of bygone days, wherein a lighted match
was placed on a particular spot of a paper sheet, and thence the name
of the advertised commodity gradually burnt itself out over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
surface, was a modification of this preparation (<a href="#Fig37_5">Fig. 5</a>). The name or
design is simply drawn with a pointed stump of wood dipped repeatedly
in the saltpeter solution, and the starting-point marked conspicuously
by a cross or black spot. When dry a match is applied to this mark.
If there is a tendency for other parts of the paper than the design itself
to burn, a short immersion in dilute alum solution, when the saltpeter
lines have dried, may be resorted to.</p>

<p><i>Electric Fire.</i>&mdash;This compound is in no way of an electric nature,
except that it burns rapidly with brilliant blue illumination. The
constituents are flowers of sulphur, saltpeter, and antimony, four parts
of the former being intermingled with ten parts of powdered saltpeter,
and then one-seventh the total quantity of powdered antimony finally
added. Thorough mixing by gentle stirring must be insured. A good
method of firing the powder is to pack it round a twist of touch-paper
in a small mustard tin, threading the fuse (A, <a href="#Fig37_6">Fig. 6</a>) through a
hole in the lid, so that it may be lighted easily. The mixture burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span>
not only brightly, but with intense heat&mdash;sufficient to melt the thin iron
of the inclosing tin.</p>

<p><i>The Lightest Element.</i>&mdash;Hydrogen is a gas at ordinary temperature,
and has the honor of being the lightest element, for all practical
purposes, known. For this reason it finds wide employment in filling
balloons and airships. The most common methods of preparation consist
of decomposing water or an acid in their several constituents,
either by the influence of electricity or the reaction of a metal. For
instance, if a pea&#8217;s bulk of sodium or potassium metal be thrown into
a basin of water, A, <a href="#Fig37_7">Fig. 7</a>, (the experimenter should not bend directly
over the vessel), a violent
reaction ensues, the
metal decomposes and
hustles round the surface
as though in feverish
excitement, and in
the case of potassium a
purple flame springs up
spontaneously. The sodium
may also be ignited
if it is thrown on
to a floating piece of
blotting-paper, or if the
water be thickened with
starch. This metal burns with a yellow flame, or rather colors the
hydrogen flame yellow.</p>

<p>Preparing hydrogen by the foregoing method is inconvenient and

following plan is usually adopted:&mdash;Support a flask (A, <a href="#Fig37_8">Fig. 8</a>), and
place zinc chips (B) in it to the depth of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch. Fit the
mouth with a cork, through which passes a delivery tube (C) and a
&#8220;thistle&#8221; funnel (D), dipping nearly to the level of the zinc. When
the gas is required, dilute sulphuric acid&mdash;one part oil of vitriol to ten
parts water&mdash;is poured down the funnel until the flask is about one-third
filled (E).</p>

<p>Five or ten minutes should be allowed after bubbling has commenced
before an attempt is made to light the gas at the delivery tube,
as otherwise air from the flask may be intermingled in the exact proportion
to cause a bad explosion. <i>No danger need be feared if several
minutes are allowed for the air to be thoroughly dispelled, or, as an
additional measure of safety, a damp towel</i> (F) <i>is wrapped round the
flask to prevent scattering of the glass in the event of a mishap.</i> The
glass delivery tube should have been softened in a spirit flame and<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
drawn to a fine point where the hydrogen issues. The gas will be
found to burn with an almost colorless flame.</p>

<p>If a glass tube (A) of larger bore than the delivery pipe be slid
over this latter while the gas burns, a peculiar musical note is produced&mdash;hollow-sounding
and shrill (<a href="#Fig37_9">Fig. 9</a>). It is caused by the rapid
succession of slight explosions which constitute the combustion of
hydrogen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig37_9">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;A musical flame.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The extreme lightness of hydrogen, as well as its combustibility,
is well illustrated by blowing a soap bubble. Connect a clay pipe with
the glass delivery tube by means of a length of india-rubber tubing,
and provide this latter with a small clip&mdash;tie-clip, for example&mdash;so
that the gas supply
may be shut off at
will (<a href="#Fig37_10">Fig. 10</a>). Let
the hydrogen pass for
a minute or so, to
clear air out of the
clay pipe, and then,
having shut off the
gas, dip the pipe bowl
into soap-suds. Next
open the clip until the
hydrogen has blown
the bubble large
enough, and then shut
off, shaking the shimmering
globe free. It will rise very quickly, just like an unballasted
balloon, and if a lighted taper be applied to its surface it will explode
to annihilation with a loud report.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Freezing a flask of
ammonia to a block of wood.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Spirits of Hartshorn.</i>&mdash;Commercial ammonia is actually an aqueous
solution of the gas, which dissolves to an abnormal extent in water.
When it has been absorbed as much as possible the liquid weighs only
22.25 as much as an equal bulk of water, owing, of course, to the
latter&#8217;s association with a compound far lighter than itself. So great
is the energy of solution that heat is dissipated from the liquid as<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
absorption proceeds. Conversely, if the gas be dispelled by blowing
air through strong liquor ammoniac, heat is rapidly absorbed at the
expense of surrounding objects. To show this, stand a small flask
in a pool of water on a wood block, and
having about half filled the flask with
fresh ammonia, blow into this through a
glass tube connected with the mouth by
a length of rubber tubing (<a href="#Fig37_11">Fig. 11</a>). No
long time should elapse before enough
heat has been abstracted from the water
to convert it into ice, so that the flask is
frozen firmly to the wood.</p>

<p>Another demonstration of water&#8217;s
avidity for ammonia gas is afforded by
the following performance. Erect one
large flask (A) in an inverted position,
so that the distance between its neck and
the table is several inches greater than its
own height. Some distance away, as shown in <a href="#Fig37_12">Fig. 12</a>, erect a small
4-oz. flask (B), and half fill it with a mixture of four parts sal-ammoniac
to three parts slaked lime (C). Fit the neck with a cork
and a delivery tube,
which has been so
bent as to pass
through a stopper in
the mouth and reach
nearly to the bottom
of a jar (D) packed
with quicklime (E).</p>

<p>Another glass
tube (F) issues
from this chamber&mdash;but
only from just
below the cork&#8217;s
under surface&mdash;and
passes upwards into
the orifice of the
large flask. A
square of paper (G, in <a href="#Fig37_12">Fig. 12</a>) is pushed over the glass tube and presses
against the mouth of the flask.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;To prove water&#8217;s affection for ammonia.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If now the mixture in the 4-oz. flask be warmed, ammonia gas
is produced, and having been robbed of moisture by the quicklime
through which it passes, travels upwards, and collects in the large inverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
flask. When the action has continued for a little while, stop
the heating and remove the delivery tube, and bring an open spirits of
salt bottle near the inverted flask&#8217;s mouth. If dense white fumes are
immediately formed, the flask is known to be filled with ammonia gas,
and must be corked up.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig37_13">

<img src="images/illo319.png" alt="" width="300" height="443" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;A novel fountain.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Beneath this container is next stood another large flask filled with
red litmus solution (A) and fitted with a stopper, through which pass
two glass tubes (M and N, in <a href="#Fig37_13">Fig. 13</a>).
One of these (N) is bent outwards,
and extends only just inside the flask&#8217;s
neck, whilst the other is long enough
to reach from the bottom of the lower
flask almost to the top of that holding
the ammonia. Instead of red litmus
solution, a liquid made by boiling
red cabbage leaves in water, and
adding <i>just enough</i> vinegar to dispel
entirely the bluish coloration, may be
used with equal success.</p>

<p>The position then is that two
flasks&mdash;of which the upper (B) holds
ammonia gas, whilst the lower retains
a pink solution&mdash;are supported
one above the other, their necks
approaching and joined by a glass
tube (M). A second glass tube (N)
also emerges from just above the
surface of the pink liquid, and is bent outwards from the flask, so that
it may be held in the mouth. When this is blown through, the pink
water is forced up the connecting tube (M) and sprays out, fountain-like,
within the upper flask. Moreover, as the ammonia is so rapidly
absorbed by the incoming water, this continually ascends to fill the
vacuum, which tends to form as the gas is dissolved. The fountain
continues to play when the blowing has ceased, and further, although
the spray presents a reddish tinge on entering the flask, it immediately
turns blue as the ammonia dissolves (C, <a href="#Fig37_13">Fig. 13</a>). This reaction indicates
the alkalinity of ammonia, such substances being capable of
neutralizing acids, which redden solutions of vegetable blues.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXVIII</b><br />
ODD EXPERIMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">To While Away Winter Hours</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> famous King Belshazzar was much dismayed to see the mysterious
writing upon the wall of his palace. Without reducing your friends
to a similar state of terror, a very easy experiment can be performed
productive of the same effect,
and if it does not exactly
make their knees strike together,
it will astonish them
very much.</p>

<p>The appliances are such
as can be found in any home,
and the strange writing can
be produced in the following
way.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig38_1">

<img src="images/illo320.png" alt="" width="350" height="426" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Showing relative positions of candle and
mirror so that patch of light is thrown on the wall.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>At one end of a dark
room erect a screen that
shall conceal you and your
apparatus effectually from
the spectators. Upon a table
behind this screen place a
large mirror, such as can be
found upon any dressing-table.
Put a lighted candle
in front of this glass, placing
the latter at such an angle
that a large patch of light is
thrown upon the wall before
you, as in <a href="#Fig38_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>The screen must, of course, hide all this from the company, who
will see nothing but the light on the wall.</p>

<p>To write your message is now a very simple matter. Dip a
coarse brush into some lamp-black water color, and, writing backwards,
inscribe what you wish upon the face of the mirror. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
message will then appear legibly upon the wall, seemingly written
by a mysterious hand.</p>

<p>By dipping the brush into clean water and washing out what you
have written upon the glass, the message on the wall will disappear as
inexplicably as it appeared in the first place.</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>A peculiar optical illusion is accomplished as follows. The wishbone
of a fowl or duck should be thoroughly cleaned, and a
thread passed several times around the prongs of the fork, as shown
in <a href="#Fig38_2">Fig. 2</a>. Having secured the thread tightly, pass a strong wooden
match between the strands, twisting it several times until the prongs
of the bone have been drawn closer together (<a href="#Fig38_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>Now, pulling out the match sufficiently to allow of one end catching
against the fork, hold the bone firmly. Releasing the match it
immediately describes a circle,
striking against the under part
of the fork, but so rapidly has
it completed this revolution
that the eye has been quite
unable to follow it. This
causes an illusion that induces
all who witness the
experiment to imagine that
the match passes through
the fork of the bone at A.</p>

<p>But if the eye was too
slow in the last experiment,
it is so officious in what is
next to be described that it sees something which really does not
take place.</p>

<p>A rather amusing experiment, and one which will afford immense

<p>Cut a circular disc of stout cardboard 12&#8243; in diameter. In the

<p>Upon the center of the disc fasten a cylindrical cardboard box
(A, <a href="#Fig38_6">Fig. 6</a>), with the penholder passing right through it. This box
should be roughly 3&#8243; high and 2&#8243; in diameter.</p>

<p>At a radius of 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&#8243; from the center describe a semicircle upon the
disc at E F (<a href="#Fig38_6">Fig. 6</a>), whilst upon the same half of the cylinder describe
a line as G H in the same figure. Now pierce about twenty-five
equidistant holes in E F and G H, joining them with thread, as in
<a href="#Fig38_7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Cover these threads with little strips of paper in such a manner
as to make a plane surface, as shown in <a href="#Fig38_8">Fig. 8</a>. Then fasten a
cork upon the end of a wire attached to the stick, and in a cleft in
this cork put a little cardboard figure as in the illustration.</p>

<p>Make the disc revolve by a rapid turn of the hand, and if a candle

<h3><span class="smcap">Life Partners</span></h3>

<p>If at any time it should happen that an engaged couple are
amongst the friends whom you wish to entertain, a very simple
piece of apparatus can be made that will give these good people
much pleasure.</p>

<p>In the four sides of a cube box, measuring 18&#8243; each way, make
an oval opening, 9&#8243; by 7&#8243;, as A, B, C, D in <a href="#Fig38_9">Fig. 9</a>. Inside the box place
two mirrors, back to back, diagonally from G to E (<a href="#Fig38_10">Fig. 10</a>), and
contrive four curtains to draw up simultaneously over the holes.</p>

<div class="split5050">

openings and mirrors.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>You must now get two couples to look through the holes,
arranging the two men opposite each other, as at A and C, and
the ladies at B and D, promising them that by looking into the
simple but magical box they shall see the future partners of their
lives and pleasures.</p>

<p>As soon as they are in position raise the curtains, when A will
see B, and C will be gazing at D, so that if you have sorted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
parties aright, they will feel so pleased with themselves and with you
that no inquiry will be made as to how the trick is done.</p>

<p>To turn from sight to hearing, the following is a simple experiment
which can be exhibited without any special apparatus.</p>

<p>Cut a plain cross from a sheet of notepaper, as in <a href="#Fig38_11">Fig. 11</a>, and
place it over a wine-glass, bending the ends to prevent it slipping
off. Almost fill the glass with water, taking great care to leave the
sides and rim perfectly dry.</p>

<p>If you damp your finger and pass it over any part of the glass
outside, a distinct humming will be
heard, but the more remarkable thing
to observe is that the cross will begin
to revolve very slowly so long as your
finger rubs a portion of the glass between
the arms of the cross&mdash;as at A
in <a href="#Fig38_11">Fig. 11</a>. Yet when you begin to
rub beneath one of the arms the paper
will remain perfectly still. A complete
revolution of the paper can be produced
by rubbing round the glass in a
circle.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig38_11">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Showing paper cross and
glass almost filled with water and
cross placed over the top.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The vibration of the glass when
emitting the notes explains this phenomenon,
although the reason that the
cross should remain still when you rub beneath one of its arms is
too technical for explanation here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span></p>

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig38_12">

<img src="images/illo325a.png" alt="" width="225" height="336" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;A &#8220;light&#8221; experiment.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Light Experiment</span></h3>

<p>Why do we wear white clothes in extreme heat and dark clothes
in the winter? To this question every one will answer that white
clothes absorb less heat than black, and that
we therefore feel the rays of the sun less.</p>

<p>Quite true; and yet, how is it that Polar
bears and other Arctic creatures exposed to
such extreme cold are clothed in white?</p>

<p>The fact is that not only does white absorb
less heat, but it serves to retain heat, and a
white coat preserves the natural warmth in
the animal&#8217;s body. This is exemplified by the
following experiment, for which only a tumbler
is required.</p>

<p>Choose a glass with the lower part faced,
as in <a href="#Fig38_12">Fig. 12</a>. Color these faces black and
white alternately, a little India ink serving for
the former and some crushed chalk and water
for the latter.</p>

<p>With a very small knob of wax fasten a pin to each face, as shown in
the figure. Having done this place a lighted candle within the glass.</p>

<p>The heat, striking the interior equally, is modified by the colors
painted on the outside to such an extent that after some little while the
wax supporting the pins of the <span class="allcaps smcap">BLACK</span> faces is melted, whilst the pins on
the white parts remain unaffected. This shows very clearly that the
white prevents the escape
of internal heat, as surely
as it prevents the penetration
of external warmth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Pyrometer</span></h3>

<p>We all know that
metals expand under heat.
The amount of such expansion
may be measured
by a simple little apparatus called a pyrometer.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig38_13">

<img src="images/illo325b.png" alt="" width="500" height="252" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;Showing how to make a pyrometer.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>On a wooden base, B, C (<a href="#Fig38_13">Fig. 13</a>), make two uprights, A and D, of
which A must be a half inch higher than D. Bore a hole a quarter
of an inch from the top of A, but not right through the wood.</p>

<p>A couple of pins must be bent into the shape of a Y and driven into<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
the top of D, as in <a href="#Fig38_13">Fig. 13</a>. With a little sealing-wax fasten a paper
pointer to the eye end of a needle and lay the needle across the pins,
P, P (<a href="#Fig38_14">Fig. 14</a>). Next place an ordinary knitting-needle in the hole at A,
and rest it over the small
needle with the pointer. The
pyrometer is now complete.</p>

<p>Put a lighted candle under
the knitting-needle between
D and A, as in the
figure, taking care that the
flame plays freely upon the
needle. As the latter grows
hot you will notice that the
pointer moves slowly from
left to right, being acted upon by the hot knitting-needle passing over
the axle at X.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig38_14">

<img src="images/illo326a.png" alt="" width="500" height="274" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;Showing needle laid in position across
pins.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If a small paper dial be made against the pointer, the amount of the
expansion can be even more clearly observed. Of course two or even
more candles may be used, the result being that the needle shows more
and more expansion as it becomes hotter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Broken Bottle</span></h3>

<p>An interesting and useful experiment with a broken bottle is depicted
in <a href="#Fig38_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>Fill the broken piece with oil to whatever level you desire it to be
cut, and stand it upon a perfectly level table. Now plunge a red-hot
poker into the oil and hold it there for a few seconds, when there will
be a loud crack, and the top of the broken part will come off, even and
smooth, as in <a href="#Fig38_16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that a sheet of glass may be cut
regularly and evenly with a pair of strong scissors.</p>

<p>A glance at <a href="#Fig38_17">Fig. 17</a> will give
an idea of how this is done. The
apparatus required is a large pail
of cold water and a pair of strong
scissors.</p>

<p>Plunge the glass, the scissors,
and the hands, right into the
water so that no part of either
scissors or glass escapes immersion.
You will now find that the
scissors cut cleanly without the
glass cracking or splintering.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that
the water deadens the vibrations
both of the scissors and the glass, thus insuring a neat and clean
fracture.</p>

with a little sealing-wax fasten three

<p>In the cork of a fair-sized jar,
which should be of some opaque

unequal heights, as shown in <a href="#Fig38_19">Fig. 19</a>. Having almost filled the jar
with clear water, place the cork with the straws so tightly that no air
can possibly enter either at the sides or by any other means than
through the straws.</p>

<p>The following strange effect will now be obtained. Pouring some
colored liquid into the top shell A, plain clear water will come from
the spout C of the lower shell B, and will continue as long as you pour
from above (<a href="#Fig38_20">Fig. 20</a>).</p>

<p>The reason of this is that the compressed air in the jar forces the
clear water through the straw at B, which, being plunged deep into<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
the clear liquid, carries off none of the colored matter passed into the
jar by means of A.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XXXIX</b><br />
MORE EXPERIMENTS<br />
TIPS AND DODGES FOR THE WINTER EVENINGS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Refractory Cork</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> interesting and amusing experiment may be performed with
a bottle and a cork.</p>

<p>Take a cork of a diameter less than the internal diameter of the
neck of the bottle you propose using, and ask a friend to make it
enter the bottle by blowing upon it.</p>

<p>At first sight this seems a very easy task, and your friend at once
proceeds to blow strongly upon the cork. This, however, instead of
making the cork enter the
bottle, causes it to fly out.</p>

<p>Again your friend tries to
overcome the troublesome
cork, on the next occasion
by blowing very gently, but
again it flies out (<a href="#Fig39_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The explanation of this
is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In blowing upon the
cork, a certain amount of
air at the same time enters
the bottle, the air in which becomes so compressed that it rapidly
ejects the cork. There are, however, three ways in which the refractory
cork may be overcome.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig39_1">

<img src="images/illo329.png" alt="" width="450" height="256" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;The refractory cork.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Since you know that by blowing on the cork it is at once ejected,
try to achieve success by performing the contrary action&mdash;that is, by
withdrawing some of the air from the bottle.</p>

<p>Indeed, the experiment will prove to you that, by so doing, you
create in the bottle a partial vacuum, and as soon as your mouth
leaves the neck of the bottle air enters it owing to atmospheric pressure.
This incoming current of air pulls with it the cork, which at
once slides into the aperture.</p>

<p>The same result may also be achieved by first warming the bottle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
when, owing to the expansion of the air, a part of it is expelled.
Directly the air inside the bottle cools, a vacuum is created, and a
current of air from without enters. If you add to this current of air
by blowing air from your mouth, you will find this quite sufficient to
cause the cork to enter the bottle. Then, again, having a straw or a
pipe-stem handy, all you have to do is to blow through the tube,
directing the air exactly on the base of the cork, which will once again
enter the aperture.</p>

<p>Whichever of these means is adopted, you must always take the
precaution of seeing that the bottle is perfectly dry. It should be
wiped every time. The moisture formed in the neck is sufficient to
prevent the cork from gliding along the glass.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Flying Coin</span></h3>

<p>You may be inclined to think that special apparatus is necessary
to make a coin fly from the bottom of a glass, but here is shown a
very simple method by
which the trick may
be performed at any
moment in your home.</p>

<p>First procure a
liqueur glass of conical
shape, having in its
largest part a diameter
not much greater than
that of a silver dollar.
At the bottom of this
glass place a quarter, and
above it, near the top of
the glass, a silver dollar,
the latter forming a kind
of cover (A, <a href="#Fig39_2">Fig. 2</a>). Now declare to your friends that, without
touching the dollar, you will make the quarter jump from the
glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig39_2">

<img src="images/illo330.png" alt="" width="450" height="322" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The flying coin.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>This at first seems to them an impossibility, but all you have to do
is to blow very strongly on the edge of the dollar. This will make
the larger coin turn about on its own diameter into a vertical position,
whilst the compressed air under the quarter causes the latter to fly
out of the glass, after which the dollar returns to its original horizontal
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Cigarette-smoking Lamp-glass</span></h3>

<p>This is a very striking experiment, and is quite easy to perform.
The apparatus is also quite simple, and may be easily obtained. It consists
of a lamp-chimney, a cork, a cigarette, together with two little valves.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig39_3">

<img src="images/illo331a.png" alt="" width="200" height="441" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The self-smoking
cigarette.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Tightly cork up one end of the lamp-chimney with a large cork, thus
hermetically sealing it. In this cork bore two holes, one following
the line of the cork&#8217;s axis and having exactly the same
diameter as the cigarette: the other being oblique with
respect to this axis, and having a much smaller diameter
(<a href="#Fig39_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figright w150" id="Fig39_4">

<img src="images/illo331b.png" alt="" width="147" height="300" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The self-smoking
cigarette.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is now necessary to make the valves. This is
done by cutting from a glove two round pieces of the
skin or leather, which, by means of
pins, may be fixed over the holes,
one being above the little hole on
the top of the cork, the other over
the large hole on the under side of
the cork.</p>

<p>The first valve allows the smoke
to escape, at the same time preventing
the entrance of any external
air, whilst the lower valve allows the smoke from
the cigarette to enter the glass tube, but will not
allow it to escape by the same hole.</p>

<p>Having thus made the valves, next plunge the
tube in the water as far as the cork, and place the
cigarette in the hole made for it. After having lit
it, proceed to make the lamp-chimney smoke it.</p>

<p>In order that it may inhale the smoke, slowly
raise the glass. By so doing a vacuum is produced
between the surface of the water and the bottom of
the cork. To destroy this vacuum, air must enter
from without, and the only means of its entrance
is through the cigarette, as the valve on the top of the cork remains
tightly closed. In passing through the cigarette this current of air
greatly assists combustion, and the smoke formed will pass with the
air into the lamp-chimney.</p>

<p>If now the glass be lowered again, the air which is compressed by
so doing closes the central valve, whilst that above the oblique tube is
opened. From this valve the smoke will ascend in clouds (<a href="#Fig39_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>In this way the glass may be made to smoke the whole cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Water Swinging</span></h3>

<p>Nearly every one has seen, at the circus or elsewhere, an acrobat
executing giddy circular movements with a glass of water, and doubtless
has wondered how it is that none of the liquid is spilt. This is
due to the action of centrifugal force.</p>

<p>Having placed the glass full of
water on the table, it is only a matter
of taking it properly with the hand,
holding it at arm&#8217;s length, and, with
the arm thus extended, describing a
complete circle, after which it may
be placed upon the table without the
loss of a single drop.</p>

<p>To insure the success of the
experiment, particular attention must
be paid to the manner in which the
glass is held. Instead of taking it
as you would when drinking, hold it with the hand reversed, the palm
being turned upwards, as shown in <a href="#Fig39_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_5">

<p>Without hesitation throw the arm in the air, and swing it, not too
quickly, but without shaking it, in the direction of the arrows in the

<p>After one complete revolution the glass should be as shown by
<a href="#Fig39_7">Fig. 7</a>; whilst in this position it may be placed on the table. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span>
first it is advisable to practice this experiment with water, but, as more
skill is acquired, other liquids, such as milk or wine, may be used as
occasion permits.</p>

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig39_8">

<img src="images/illo333.png" alt="" width="250" height="332" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The spoon mirror.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">A Novel Mirror</span></h3>

<p>A simple method of illuminating the back of the mouth and throat,
especially when throat trouble is suspected, may often be found
extremely useful. Here is a means of
supplying, at a moment&#8217;s notice, an extemporized
illuminant of this kind.</p>

<p>Take a well-cleaned spoon, and hold
it against a candle flame, when you form
an excellent mirror, which will permit you
to concentrate the rays of light and produce
at the back of the throat enough
illumination for the making of a careful
examination (<a href="#Fig39_8">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p>A silver spoon, moreover, allows you
to study the curious properties of curved
mirrors. Holding the hollow part of the
spoon before your face, notice that the
head is at the bottom; turn the spoon
round, and you have the bulging part a
convex mirror, which will show an image, very long and narrow.
If you approach this face in the spoon little by little, you will see
the nose attain the most amusing proportions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Disappearing Coin</span></h3>

<p>If you look at an object which has been placed in water, owing
to the phenomenon of refraction, the article appears in a different
position from that in which it really is.</p>

<p>It is due to this phenomenon, therefore, that a stick, when half
plunged into water, seems to be bent or broken.</p>

<p>A very interesting experiment based on this principle is the
<span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Take a bowl full of water, and at the bottom place a coin. Next
request one of your friends to lower his head until his eye, the edge
of the bowl, and the near edge of the cent, appear to be in the same
line.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is not the coin itself that your friend
can see, but only the image created by refraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span></p>

<p>Now, keeping your friend in the same position, inform him that
you intend to make the coin
disappear from his view.</p>

<p>To do this, remove some
of the water from the bowl,
which may be accomplished
by means of a small syringe
(<a href="#Fig39_9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_9">

<img src="images/illo334a.png" alt="" width="350" height="266" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;The disappearing coin.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Directly you lower the level
of the water, your friend will
no longer be able to see the
image of the coin, which will
be hidden by the side of the
bowl. If, however, the extracted
water be replaced, the image of the coin immediately reappears.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Electrified Paper</span></h3>

<p>Very few people realize that paper can be electrified at a moment&#8217;s
notice, no special apparatus for the purpose being required.</p>

<p>Take a piece of light paper, which should have been well dried,
and rub it briskly with a clothes brush, silk handkerchief, or even the
open hand.</p>

<p>After a little time the paper, becoming electrified, will adhere
to your face, your hands, or your clothes, as easily as if it were
attached by means of gum.</p>

<p>Nor is this property confined to
thin paper. Thick paper, when dried,
will act in the same manner. For
instance, take a postcard, dry it, and
rub it, and you will notice that, as is
the case with sealing-wax, glass, sulphur,
&amp;c., the card has the power of
attracting light bodies, such as small
pieces of cork.</p>

<p>The following interesting experiment
may be carried out with an
electrified postcard and a walking-stick.</p>

<p>Balance the walking-stick over the back of a chair, and announce
that you can make the stick fall without touching it, without blowing
it, or without interfering with the chair. This is easily possible by
utilizing the electrified postcard.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_10">

<img src="images/illo334b.png" alt="" width="350" height="294" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;The electrified postcard.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span></p>

<p>First rub it on the sleeve of your coat. Now hold it near one end
of the stick, and you will notice that the latter follows it as iron follows
a magnet (<a href="#Fig39_10">Fig. 10</a>), until the moment when the equilibrium being
destroyed, the stick falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Of course the experiment may be varied by using any other
suitable article in place of the stick, as for instance a fishing-rod.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Electrified Balloons</span></h3>

<p>From the last experiment it may have been gathered that if a piece
of paper is dried and rubbed with a silk handkerchief or the dry hand
it will adhere to the face, arms, or clothing.</p>

<p>It may not be so widely known, however, that if toy balloons
be filled with air, and then stroked for a short time with a piece
of fur, they will act in the same way
as the electrified paper.</p>

<p>It is rather amusing to see these
balloons, after being treated thus,
placed against the wall or ceiling,
where they will stick as if they were
glued there.</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig39_11">

<img src="images/illo335.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;The electrified balloons.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Having entertained your friends
in this manner, you may, by way of
a little change, take two of these
toy balloons, and, after having electrified
them, suspend them from the
same point by means of two silken threads.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to find that the balloons now repel each other
in the same manner as pith balls do (<a href="#Fig39_11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Exploding Flour</span></h3>

<p>Flour will create an explosion!</p>

<p>Take a large handful of flour, and leave it for some time near the
fire, in order that every trace of dampness may be expelled.</p>

<p>Whilst the flour is drying take a large tin box (a cracker tin will do
admirably), and near the bottom make a small hole.</p>

<p>Through this hole pass the end of a piece of india-rubber tubing,
and place the handful of dry flour in front of it.</p>

<p>At the other end of the box place a short piece of candle, and after
lighting it, cover the box with the lid, taking care that it is not too
firmly fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span></p>

<p>If you now blow down the tube with your mouth, or better still,
with a pair of bellows
an explosion at once
takes place, as a result
of which the lid
will be blown off (<a href="#Fig39_12">Fig.
12</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig39_12">

<img src="images/illo336.png" alt="" width="400" height="203" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;Exploding flour.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If flour be not available
the experiment
may be performed with
equal success by using
fine dust, such as may
be found on the backs
of pictures, or collected from any elevated parts of the room.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Apparently Impossible</span></h3>

<p>Have you ever had tea on the top of a mountain? If so, you will
agree that your cup of tea could by no means be termed excellent.</p>

<p>Now, why is it that a cup of tea made on a mountain-top is much
inferior to one made at a lower level? If the fault lay in the tea, the
defect could be easily remedied, but such is not the case, for it
depends upon the fact that water on the top of a mountain boils at a
lower temperature than water at the sea-level.</p>

<p>In order to make a good cup of tea, the water must boil at a
temperature very near 100&deg; C., and it is at this temperature that the
water is generally boiled in your homes.</p>

<p>Why is it, then, that water boils at different temperatures at
different altitudes? It is because, as the altitude is increased, so the
atmospheric pressure becomes less.</p>

<p>At sea-level, atmospheric pressure is equal to about 15 lbs. to the
square inch, but at the top of a mountain it is much less. The
greater the atmospheric pressure the more heat is required before
the bubbles of vapor formed within the water can break at the
surface.</p>

<p>After this explanation, perhaps the subjoined experiment will be
attempted with additional interest.</p>

<p>Take a flask, to which should be fitted a good cork or india-rubber
stopper, and in it boil some water, taking care of course to remove
the stopper beforehand.</p>

<p>After some minutes the steam from the boiling water will have
expelled all the air from the flask. Now remove the source of heat,
at the same time quickly inserting the stopper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page337">[337]</span></p>

<p>If the flask is allowed to stand for a minute or two, the temperature
of the water will fall considerably below 100&deg; C.</p>

<p>Next inform your friends that,
without applying any extra heat, you
will cause the water in the flask to
boil vigorously again. This seems
to them impossible, especially when
you tell them that you are going to
do it by means of cold water. Quickly
turn the glass upside down, and
squeeze a sponge soaked in cold
water on its upturned under-surface.
Immediately the liquid inside will
begin to boil, as if extra heat had
been applied (<a href="#Fig39_13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_13">

<img src="images/illo337a.png" alt="" width="350" height="421" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;A curious boiling experiment.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>But how are you to explain
this apparently extraordinary phenomenon?</p>

<p>Well, directly the cold water
comes in contact with the flask it
causes the steam contained therein to condense, and, as no air can
enter, thanks to the well-fitting cork, the pressure on the surface of
the warm water is now considerably
less than it was
before.</p>

<p>Directly the pressure is
lessened the vapor bubbles
contained within the warm
water are able to rise to the
surface, and the water is seen
to boil merrily.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making Coal Gas</span></h3>

<p>Here is a very simple
way of obtaining coal gas.</p>

<p>Procure an ordinary long
clay tobacco pipe, the bowl
of which should be filled with
very small pieces of coal.
Carefully cover the top with soft clay, and put the bowl in the fire,
with the long stem protruding through the bars. Now watch this end
of the pipe very closely and see what happens.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_14">

<img src="images/illo337b.png" alt="" width="350" height="349" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;Simple gas-making.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span></p>

<p>Very soon you will notice a light-colored smoke issuing from
the mouthpiece, but after a time this smoke disappears. But what
happens if you hold a lighted match to the mouthpiece of the pipe?
Immediately a bright yellow flame appears (<a href="#Fig39_14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>The gas now burning is the same gas as is burnt in your house,
although this latter, of course, is much purer.</p>

<p>If now you take the pipe from the fire, allow it to cool and then
break it, you will be surprised to find that its contents have changed
in appearance, for, in place of the coal, you will see what looks like a
cinder. This is the coke. Thus you have manufactured gas from
coal, at the same time producing coke.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments with Carbonic Acid Gas</span></h3>

<p>In a <a href="#Ref9">previous chapter</a>, when describing how to make a miniature
cannon, it was explained that the &#8220;gunpowder&#8221; with which the
&#8220;shell&#8221; was fired is in reality carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to show how to generate it, in order that
you may discover for yourselves some
of its properties.</p>

<p>There are several ways of obtaining
carbonic acid gas, but most of these
are of a complicated nature. The
following, however, is an extremely
simple method.</p>

<p>Take a 6-oz. or 8-oz. flask, and fit
it with a cork with a hole, in which
may be fitted a piece of glass tubing.</p>

<p>This tubing should be bent twice
at right angles, as shown in <a href="#Fig39_15">Fig. 15</a>,
and the longer end should be allowed
to dip into a large glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_15">

<img src="images/illo338.png" alt="" width="350" height="401" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 15.&mdash;A carbonic acid gas
experiment.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Into the flask pour a little lemonade,
soda water or ginger ale, and after
replacing the cork or tube, heat the flask by means of a gas-burner or
spirit lamp.</p>

<p>You will notice that bubbles of gas are given off, and, as this gas
is considerably heavier than air, it will, after being forced up the
tube, displace the air in the glass, and gradually fill it. To test
whether the glass is full, hold a match in the top. If the match is
extinguished, the glass which is full may be removed. In this way
several glasses can be filled, care being taken to cover each with a
glass plate or cardboard disc to prevent diffusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span></p>

<p>From this experiment you will have discovered the three main
properties of this gas (commonly known as carbon dioxide)&mdash;that it
is colorless, is considerably
heavier than air, and will
not support combustion. Its
high density affords another
interesting experiment, which
consists of pouring the gas
from one glass to another
(<a href="#Fig39_16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig39_16">

<img src="images/illo339a.png" alt="" width="350" height="359" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;Pouring carbon dioxide from one glass
to another.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Take two glasses, one
full of air and the other
containing the carbonic acid
gas, and into each plunge a
lighted match. The match
of course will burn in the
glass containing air, whilst
it will be immediately extinguished
when it comes
in contact with the carbon
dioxide. You have thus
clearly shown which glass
contains air and which contains the gas. Now take the glass containing
the gas and pour its contents into the other glass, in exactly
the same way as you would pour in water. Again test with a lighted
match and you will find that the gas has passed from one glass to
another, thus proving that it is much heavier than air.</p>

<p>Next take two glasses, one containing air and the other carbonic
acid gas, and, by means of a
clay pipe, blow a soap bubble
into each, carefully watching the
different manners in which they
behave. That dropped into the
glass containing air will sink to
the bottom, where, coming in
contact with the glass, it will
burst. The other bubble, however,
as soon as it reaches the
gas in the glass, rebounds owing
to the high density of the carbon dioxide, but after a time, when it
has settled down, it will float motionless on the surface (<a href="#Fig39_17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p>Before you finish experimenting you should know how to detect
the presence of carbon dioxide. Take a little lime water, which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
be obtained from any druggist, and pour it into a glass containing
carbon dioxide. Shake the glass, and carefully observe the change
which takes place. The lime water, which was previously colorless,
has assumed a certain milkiness, and if allowed to stand the white
powder causing this milkiness will settle at the bottom of the glass.
This powder proves to be calcium carbonate, or chalk, which is always
formed when lime water comes in contact with carbon dioxide, so that
you have here a means of detecting the presence of carbon dioxide.
Breathe into a little lime water and you will learn, from the milky
appearance it at once assumes, that the air we exhale contains a certain
quantity of this interesting gas.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XL</b><br />
PHOTO PASTIMES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Camera Knights&#8217; Experiments</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been presumed in commencing these notes that most
would-be experimenters already possess a camera, or will at least
shortly do so. Thus the greater number of experiments are such
as would interest a camera fiend more deeply than the ordinary
reader, although the latter might still derive much enjoyment from
conducting them so far as the lack of a &#8220;dark box&#8221; will allow him.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be as well to spend a paragraph at the outset in
describing simply and noting a few peculiarities about the commonplace
camera. Photography means drawing by the agency of light.
Now light is reflected from an illuminated object in straight lines or
rays, of which a proportion may be collected by a lens and thrown
in points upon a surface behind. (See <a href="#Fig40_1">Fig. 1</a>, A, illuminated object;
B, lens; C, surface behind lens; D, rays of light thrown upon
surface C.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig40_1">

<img src="images/illo341.png" alt="" width="500" height="202" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Rays of light collected by lens and thrown upon surface behind.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The front of a camera contains the lens, and is provided with
a movable shutter, so that light may be only allowed to enter the
dark box when a picture is to be taken on one of the sensitive plates
inside. According to <a href="#Fig40_2">Fig. 2</a>&mdash;which represents a
camera in position<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
to photograph the object A&mdash;the light is reflected in rays, which are
collected in myriads of groups and cast pointed upon the surface
of the sensitized plate B. Such ray groups&mdash;being parallel when
they leave the object and pointed after passing the lens&mdash;are termed
pencils of light, a most applicable name when they are employed in
&#8220;sketching&#8221; a portrait on the photographic plate.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig40_2">

<img src="images/illo342.png" alt="" width="450" height="224" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Camera in position to photograph object A.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It will be seen that the action of the lens causes the base of the
object to be registered upon the top of the plate, and <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the picture is taken upside down. Another noticeable feature about
the magazine box camera, which does not, however, apply to the
focussing camera with bellows, is that it may not be placed nearer than
a certain distance (usually 10 feet or thereabouts) to the object photographed,
or else the picture obtained will be blurred. The remembrance
of this simple fact will save the loss of many plates to the tyro.</p>

<p>Finally a last note remains to be taken of the &#8220;stops.&#8221; These are
really various sized holes in a metal screen, any one of which may be
placed at will before the lens, and by the use of which the sharpness
or distinctness of the photograph may be improved. Thus a lens at
full aperture will not give such a sharp picture as would be obtained if
a small hole were used, but, as the amount of light permitted to pass
in the latter case is much diminished, a longer exposure must be given.
Consequently when a short-timed snapshot is being secured, the largest
practicable aperture or stop should be employed, even though the
sharpness of the picture be thereby to some extent sacrificed.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly reviewed the essential features of a camera,
arrangements may be made for conducting our first experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span></p>

<h3>Experiment A.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Fireside Photo</span></h3>

<p>Probably no souvenir can give greater pleasure to the amateur
photographer, or prove more acceptable to his bosom chums, than their
portrait, as a fireside group,
lighted by the glow from a
genial fire. Nor is this difficult
of attainment.</p>

<p>First the figures should
be grouped seated on chairs&mdash;and
perhaps some standing
behind, if many faces are to
be included&mdash;in a quarter
circle from one chimney-corner,
whilst the camera
may be securely placed some 9 or 10 feet away, about the position
shown at X in <a href="#Fig40_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig40_3">

<img src="images/illo343.png" alt="" width="450" height="221" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Relative positions of camera and sitters
for a fireside photo.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Next some shade like a small fire-screen must be placed between
the blaze and the camera, in order to protect the sensitized plate from
the full glare of the firelight. Now of course the photograph is not
actually secured by the coal flame illumination, which would not be
bright enough to give proper exposure, so recourse is had to dropping
some material into the fire which will burn rapidly with a bright white
flame. Magnesium powder is generally used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Supposing the group to have been arranged and the camera firmly
in position, the person (B, in <a href="#Fig40_3">Fig. 3</a>) seated next the grate should hold
a tablespoonful of saltpeter and also a square inch or so of sheet zinc.
Then, all being so far ready, let the outside member of the group
(marked A in <a href="#Fig40_3">Fig. 3</a>) open the camera shutter and slip back to his
seat, whilst the flashlight operator drops the saltpeter and zinc successively
among the glowing coals. The flame of dazzling brilliancy
which results records the sitters&#8217; figures on the plate, so that directly
it is over, the person (A) may again visit the camera and close the
shutter. His movements will not be noticeable, since they are made
before and after the flashlight.</p>

<p>The operation of development may be proceeded with at once and
should go fairly easily, but flashlight exposures are difficult to estimate
accurately, and therefore, although a square inch of zinc has sufficed
for a small group with stop and an extra rapid plate, this amount may
have to be increased if the group be large or if other conditions be
changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page344">[344]</span></p>

<p>One last hint as to behavior of the sitters. Let them sit as
naturally and quietly as possible, but be advised to <i>blink their eyes
as much as the bright light prompts them</i> rather than keep them staring
wide open, when their faces must wear a most inane expression in
the finished photo.</p>

<h3>Experiments B.&mdash;&#8220;<span class="smcap">Photo-Chemical</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>Salts of silver form the basis of most modern photographic processes.
Thus in order to perform chemical experiments of a photographic
nature, some solution of silver must be available, the nitrate
salt being usually employed.</p>

<div class="figright w150" id="Fig40_4">

<img src="images/illo344.png" alt="" width="125" height="274" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Silver
solution and
precipitate.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is best procured at the druggist&#8217;s in solution or as crystals, in
which latter case it must be dissolved for use in clean rain or distilled
water. The solution need be only weak, but must be kept in a dark
bottle screened from daylight. Chemical test-tubes, if they can be
obtained, will be found best for the experiments.</p>

<p>(1) Prepare a weak solution of table salt, and add it drop by
drop to a little of the silver nitrate in a test tube (or wine-glass as
a makeshift). A white sediment is precipitated, which, by shading
part of the tube with a band of paper and exposing to daylight,
may be shown to be sensitive to light, inasmuch as the unscreened
part will rapidly turn purple. This precipitate consists of silver
chloride, which, in combination with unaltered nitrate,
forms the essential ingredient of printing paper. In
<a href="#Fig40_4">Fig. 4</a>, A is Solution; B, Precipitate; C, Band of
Paper.</p>

<p>(2) Photographic plates are coated with bromide
of silver, a yellow substance, which may be prepared
similarly to the previous precipitate by adding potassium
bromide solution (instead of table salt) to the nitrate
of silver. Its appearance does not change rapidly
under the influence of light, but if first exposed and
then treated with a developing solution the yellow
color very soon changes to black&mdash;finely divided
metallic silver being, in fact, produced. Actually, light
more readily alters the constitution of the bromide
than that of the white chloride, but the former knows
better how to preserve an outward appearance of composure.</p>

<p>(3) Suppose, now, another solution be made, this time of the
fixing salt known familiarly to every camera knight as &#8220;Hypo.&#8221;
When this is added to either the white chloride or yellow bromide<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
precipitates above noticed, they gradually dissolve away, except such
portions as have changed color under the influence of light.</p>

<p>Such action constitutes the process of fixing a photograph, whereby
the sensitive silver compound is removed from those parts of the
paper or plate which have more or less escaped the influence of
light.</p>

<p>(4) This experiment is an aquatic performance in which one actor
only&mdash;our old acquaintance Hypo&mdash;takes part. Provided proper care
be taken in the preparatory stages, it will afford at the climax as
excellent a spectacle as many another more complex.</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>A tumbler glass full of saturated solution has first to be prepared,
and this is best done by tying about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. of Hypo in a piece of
muslin, so that it may be held against the rim of the glass and
allowed to hang in hot water after the manner of <a href="#Fig40_5">Fig. 5</a>. When
an appreciable quantity of the salt has dissolved, the liquid being
but lukewarm, the muslin bag may be removed and the solution
stirred gently. Then it must be stood somewhere firm, and
allowed to remain absolutely undisturbed until cold. There should
then be a glass full of clear liquid, and the phenomenon is at
hand.</p>

<p>Let the smallest crystal of solid Hypo be dropped in this liquid,
or let it but be disturbed, and behold! a wonderful transformation
proceeds, until the glass interior becomes a shimmering mass
of sparkling crystals. The reason of this curious behavior is not
far to seek. Hypo, in common with most chemicals, dissolves to a
greater extent in hot water than in cold, but is different, inasmuch
as the excess of salt does not settle out as the solution becomes cold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
Cold solution is therefore really over-saturated, and to such an extent
that only an extra crystal or the least disturbance is sufficient to
upset the delicate balance, upon which climax the great excess of
Hypo soon settles out.</p>

<p>(5)  This is another reaction in which Hypo takes part, but one
other substance is required as well, viz. permanganate of potash.
Condy&#8217;s fluid is equally suitable, and in either case the solution need
only be weak&mdash;just a transparent deep pink color. The vessel
containing this permanganate may be about half full. When Hypo
solution is gradually dripped into this and the mixture stirred,
the color is immediately dispelled, leaving the liquid clear as
water.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as every photographer knows the necessity for washing
his prints until all fixing salt is removed, this decoloring action may
be fully employed in testing the washing water occasionally. When
it no longer affects the tint of a pink permanganate solution he may
rest assured that the deleterious Hypo&mdash;like some friends in being
welcome so they stop not too long&mdash;has really departed. For the
ready performance of this experiment it may be noted that any solution
can most easily be &#8220;dropped in drips&#8221; from a bottle whose
cork is cut grooved at both sides (<a href="#Fig40_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig40_7">

<img src="images/illo347.png" alt="" width="300" height="355" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Sensitizing blue-print paper.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3>Experiment C.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blue Print Paper</span></h3>

<p>Engineers&#8217; drawings have for many years past been copied upon
ferro-prussiate, or &#8220;blue print&#8221; paper. The original design being
made in opaque ink upon tracing linen, a sheet of the sensitive paper
is held against this in strong daylight until blue coloration has
advanced everywhere except beneath the ink lines of the drawing.
These remain yellow, or rather white, when finished, as the excess
of sensitive salt is removed by washing.</p>

<p>Since this last operation is in itself all-sufficient to insure permanency,
the simplicity is unique. In fact, the impossibilty of
securing other colors than blue has been the only factor to exclude
this process from far wider use.</p>

<p>The preparation of the sensitive surface presents no great difficulties,
provided a drawing-paper of good quality be used. It should
be cut into strips about 6 inches wide, which are passed one by one
up and down (see <a href="#Fig40_7">Fig. 7</a>) through a dish containing the following
solution: 1 oz. ferri-cyanide of potash + 4 oz. water, added to 1 oz.
ammonio-citrate of iron + 4 oz. water. (<i>Note</i>&mdash;4 oz. water = nearly
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> pint.) This must be done in very dull
light&mdash;candle or paraffin<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
oil by preference&mdash;and the wet paper pinned up to dry in a dark
cupboard, hanging from the
edge of a shelf or other projecting
support. Then it may
be cut into pieces of the required
size and stored with a
wrapping of tissue and brown
paper in a handy box.</p>

<p>All manner of designs may
be produced on this paper,
such for example as fern leaves,
lace, and embroidery. Actual
sea-view photos or imitation
moonlight views also look very
well indeed. Another notion
is to secure the copy of some
picture printed in black on
thin paper, which has been
oiled and dried in order to
render it translucent for quicker
printing. The final washings
should be thorough, and then the blue print will last its maker as
long as the latter cares to keep it.</p>

<h3>Experiment D.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Show the Constituents of White Light</span></h3>

<p>Few physicists to-day doubt that light consists of waves set up
in an all-pervading medium called ether; that, moreover, white light
is composed of different tinted rays&mdash;to be seen reflected from the
bevel edge of a looking-glass, or indeed from the more natural
rainbow&mdash;which further are caused by the different lengths of waves
whereby the colored lights are propagated.</p>

<p>Now we may produce these phenomena for ourselves by cutting
a slit 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long in a temporary window-shutter, or, more conveniently,
in the end of a large wooden box (A, <a href="#Fig40_8">Fig. 8</a>). Near this
a glass prism, such as once adorned gas-pendants so profusely, must
be supported (B, <a href="#Fig40_8">Fig. 8</a>) on a block of wood, and at the opposite end
of the box a sheet of paper pinned to the inside (C, <a href="#Fig40_8">Fig. 8</a>). The
arrangement is shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>Now notice, if you regard this screen from the open top&mdash;a large
cloth covering head and box in order to keep out superfluous light&mdash;a
band of color is depicted thereon, gradating gently like a rainbow
from violet through blue and yellow to red. Thus the white light<span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span>
which entered through the slit has been separated into its component
parts. So far, gorgeous enough! But for the photographer much
greater interest is at hand, will he proceed as follows. Place the box
so that bright sunshine enters through the slit, and after fastening a
piece of blue print paper instead of the white on the box interior,
allow this to print, at the same time excluding extraneous light by a
dark cloth overspread. When this piece of paper has been washed
and fixed, the colored band should have registered itself in various
shades of blue, from which it will be noticeable that the purple and
blue lights have darkened the paper most, whilst red and yellow
hardly affect it at all. If ordinary printing paper, or still better, a
photographic plate (in which latter case a considerably shorter exposure
will suffice, and outside light must be rigorously excluded) be
used, instead of the blue print paper, the result is still more striking.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig40_8">

<img src="images/illo348.png" alt="" width="600" height="239" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The refraction of white light into its constituent colors.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>From this experiment further is to be gathered the reason for
developing plates by red light, which evidently does not affect the
sensitive surface in any appreciable degree. But, on the other hand,
special orthochromatic plates are made which, by dyeing, have been
rendered sensitive to the yellow rays as well as to the blue, and if one
of these be employed to &#8220;take&#8221; the colored band, technically called
&#8220;spectrum,&#8221; a totally different gradation is obtained compared with
that on an ordinary plate or on &#8220;blue print&#8221; paper.</p>

<p>Then again, suppose instead of sunlight, ordinary lamplight or
incandescent gas be used as an illuminant, the gradation varies, whilst
still another modification is to photograph the spectrum of a methylated
spirit-flame in which common salt is being burnt. In this case
the light is so yellow that an orthochromatic plate must be used.
Another illuminant worth testing is magnesium ribbon, which also
may be ignited in the spirit-flame.</p>

<p>Before saying a final adieu to these spectrum results, one last item<span class="pagenum" id="Page349">[349]</span>
remains for remark&mdash;last but not least. We say that the series of
visible colors extended from violet through blue and yellow to red,
and that darkness obtained at each end. Well! Mount a plate or
piece of printing paper inside the box, so that half of it is well in the
darkness beyond the bluish-violet bands, and expose long enough to
secure a slight opacity in these parts (<i>i.e.</i> where the blue bands fell)
when the plate is developed and fixed. The half of the plate which
was in darkness and therefore apparently received no exposure, nevertheless
develops darker than the remainder, seeming to indicate that
some light, although invisible to the human eye, had affected the
sensitive silver compounds in the plate. This is actually the case.
The rays of light which exert this wonderful influence are called
&#8220;ultra-violet,&#8221; meaning beyond the violet, and their existence explains,
amongst other matters, why photography of the heavens has revealed
the presence of many thousands more stars than can ever be seen
by man. Such stars emit only &#8220;ultra violet&#8221; light.</p>

<h3>Experiment E.&mdash;<span class="smcap">One Person in Two Places&mdash;and Spiritualism</span></h3>

<p>Pictures of a man decapitating himself, or of the reader&#8217;s sister
turning the skipping-rope for another girl, who is herself, may justly
be called mystifying. Not only may they almost deceive the operator
himself, but will quite nonplus the uninitiated, to whom proofs may
thus be presented of the most impossible happenings. Two methods
are applicable to the production of such freak portraits, <span class="nowrap">viz:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) To photograph the entire picture in two separate halves on
the plate, moving the sitter from one position to another for each
exposure.</p>

<p>(2) To employ a background as dark and dim as practicable,
whilst well-lighting the sitter and furniture, and giving a separate
exposure for each position of the model. The latter procedure is by
far the simpler, and provided reasonably correct exposures are given,
success should not be very elusive.</p>

<p>To take for a concrete example the portrait of a boy playing
checkers with himself. Hang up a curtain of black or deep-red
material in some dark recess of a room, and a few feet before it stand
a small bamboo table with checker-board, &amp;c., complete, at which the
person to be photographed may be posed sitting. As mentioned
above, all available light must be concentrated on the group, whilst
if the model be wearing light clothes, the effect will be enhanced
accordingly.</p>

<p>As to the camera, this may with greatest advantage be of the
focussing type, or at any rate a box instrument fitted with magnifiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page350">[350]</span>
so that by being placed near to the sitter the latter may be rendered
large and sharp in the portrait whilst the background remains indistinct.
This should be of such a size that its somber image well
covers the whole plate. A suggested arrangement for the tableau is
sketched in <a href="#Fig40_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<p>The first exposure may be made with the person seated at 1&mdash;the
left-hand side of the table&mdash;he either resting one finger on a checker
as if about to make his
move, or adopting such
other pose as his acting
capabilities may suggest.</p>

<p>Primarily the time
of exposure should be
just sufficient for the
light-clothed sitter, and
therefore not enough
for the table and background,
which receive a
second exposure. This
should be made when
the model has taken his
chair to the opposite
side of the table, and
again assumed a position
natural to the player, who anxiously watches his opponent&#8217;s play.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig40_9">

<img src="images/illo350.png" alt="" width="500" height="342" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;One person in two places.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>All possible care must, of course, be taken to keep the table
undisturbed during the model&#8217;s movements, and also to insure that no
lighter object than the sitter himself has a place in either exposure
just where he appears in the other. For example, a pile of books
must not be photographed during the first exposure just behind or
in front of the position which the model is to occupy during the
second exposure; otherwise the vision of books through the person&#8217;s
transparent chest, or a similar incongruous phenomenon, will result.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spirit Photography</span></h3>

<p>Spirit or ghost photography is but a modification of these
methods. The chief element of success is to ignore the caution of
the preceding paragraph, and render the ghost figure as transparent as
possible. The first exposure should be an adequate one of the human
model, who has twisted himself into an attitude of groveling terror
compatible with the fright from which he is supposed to be suffering,
whilst the background behind him must be dark and indistinct, if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page351">[351]</span>
is next to impersonate the spook. The latter&#8217;s surroundings, on the
contrary, may be as detailed and well-lighted as convenient, because
the white-robed figure is to appear transparent.</p>

<p>A sheet will be fit apparel for the &#8220;spirit,&#8221; and must be large
enough to drape entirely the gliding form with outspread arms.</p>

<p>The second exposure must be abnormally short, so as just to obtain
a faint impression of the sheet and its folds. Finally, if the terror-stricken
person can maintain his attitude of fear during the first
exposure, and also for the photograph of the ghost, whose r&ocirc;le may be
taken by some one else beneath a sheet, there is no necessity to have
any part of the background unusually dark. Still, darkness is said to
favor spooks, so the background is perhaps entirely a matter of choice.</p>

<p>With such dash toward the borders of the spiritual realm, this series
of photo experiments must conclude. The most ardent camera fiend
can scarcely denounce them as embracing too narrow a field when he
considers that ghosts as well as mundane matters&mdash;psychical and
physical alike&mdash;have been approached. Even if his finger-tips do
not resemble ebony with silver nitrate, he may still rightly term his
hobby the &#8220;Black Art.&#8221; And his friends! Well, if present at the
researches, may their remarks be unheard. Doubtless they will ponder
deeply, and conclude that the camera does sometimes lie.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="padr5pc">&middot;</span><span class="padl5pc padr5pc">&middot;</span><span

class="padl5pc">&middot;</span></p>

<p>Sun pictures of the earliest types had been no long time in
existence before a rumor spread that photography could not lie.
Critics and admirers of the new process rightly enough concluded
that a knight of the camera must be constrained to narrow interpretations
by his instruments as no artist is by his brushes. But this conclusion,
held widely now as then, is only in part correct. The
camera records the relative position of objects absolutely, but may on
the other hand ruthlessly destroy all sense of perspective, or render
globular images of rectilinear buildings. Nor are these the only
peculiarities which, in themselves disadvantageous, may frequently
be turned to account by the photographer.</p>

<p>Sensitive plates are seldom correctly exposed. They either suffer
under- or over-exposure, and when there is a gross error the resulting
picture either lacks detail and is blotchy, or else presents the light
gradation of a London fog. But, as a set-off to these failings, it might
be noted that moonlight pictures are obtainable by excessively short
daylight exposures, which give only the outline of the objects, and a
contrast between light and shade appropriate to night scenes, whilst
photographs of flowers, portraits, and cloud studies may mostly receive
full exposure with advantage, the softness of lighting engendered
lending additional charm to such subjects.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;Slanting screen (C) with circular aperture to equalize
exposures of sky (A) and foreground (B) in landscapes.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Landscapes commonly reveal over-exposure of the sky or inadequate
exposure of the ground and objects, because the amounts of
light emitted by these respective portions differ so much. To obviate
this difficulty an early
photograph worker
devised, and indeed
used, the arrangement
of a circular
aperture before the
lens, slanting so that
it might not admit
such large parallels
of light from the sky
as from the ground
portion. The device
is more easily understood
from the accompanying sketch (<a href="#Fig40_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

&#8220;modeling&#8221; in portraiture.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The portrait hunter should rejoice to realize that, by judicious
procedure, persons of the coarsest complexion may be flattered in
their likenesses. Not the least valuable dodge is to render freckles
and red blotches invisible by the use of orthochromatic plates, and,
if necessary, a yellow screen, which
articles prevent the pink skin from
securing any advantage over the insular
blotches in point of actinic light
value.</p>

<p>A supplementary method of securing
pleasant portrait effects is to mount
a disc of cardboard (A, <a href="#Fig40_11">Fig. 11</a>), round
whose edge holes of various sizes from
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch diameter and about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch apart are cut (B, <a href="#Fig40_11">Fig. 11</a>), in
front of the camera on a spindle (C,
<a href="#Fig40_11">Fig. 11</a>) as shown. Any one of the
holes should be adjustable exactly in
front of the lens, and the mode of usage is to spin the card disc rapidly
whilst the exposure is being given. This should, of course, be proportionately
longer than usual.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Novel Results</span></h3>

<p>Excellent imitations of crayon pictures are to be produced by
taking the required photograph through a negative screen, which has
been made by copying to equal size or slight reduction, a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span>
rough drawing-paper rubbed evenly with charcoal. It is employable
in two ways, either by keeping it in contact with the sensitive plate
in the dark slide whilst the photograph is being taken&mdash;a slightly longer
exposure being given&mdash;or else holding it in the frame on the opposite
side of the negative to the sensitive paper during printing, which is
conducted in the sunshine.</p>

<p>By systems of double or triple printing, all manner of novel
results are obtainable. The only difficulty presented in this work is
that of correct registration, but if printing paper&mdash;the most usual
medium&mdash;be employed, this should not be insurmountable even at the
first trial. As a first instance of these compositions, suppose out of
black paper 4 inches by 6 inches, a piece be removed the shape of the
negative portion required, and this mask be used to print through on
to a sensitized postcard. The black shape removed should have been
gummed on to tissue paper and this used, after the picture portion has
been secured, to print a border&mdash;showing the grain of the translucent
paper&mdash;around the photograph.</p>

<p>For a second, and last, example of triple printing, proceed by first
preparing the negative of a picture frame, in which, however, an ordinary
plain canvas surface has superseded the work of art. The idea
is then, by multiple printing, to introduce a camera view into this frame
image, and so make the result resemble the copy of another painting.</p>

<p>Cut a black paper mask with an aperture the exact size of the
canvas image in the frame negative, and through this mask print the
photograph required a shade lighter than usual. Then substitute
the frame negative, and, with the same mask in place, secure a slight
record of the inner canvas image over the photograph already printed.
This gives the requisite oil painting effect. Lastly the piece of black
paper, originally removed to form the mask, is fixed over the canvas
image of the frame negative and the sensitive paper replaced in
position, so that registration and printing of the frame periphery is
secured. Then toning and fixing ensue, and the &#8220;fraud&#8221; is complete.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLI</b><br />
HOW TO MAKE AND WORK MARIONETTES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Constructing the Stage</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Marionettes</span>, though claiming no rivalry to the time-honored institution
of Punch and Judy, have a great charm of their own, and, with
no traditional story of Punch, Judy, and Dog Toby, are at liberty
to perform whatever play their manager may desire.</p>

<p>Although it is possible, of course, to purchase ready-made Marionette
theaters and puppets, the purpose of this chapter is to describe
a method by which the whole apparatus
can be constructed at home at the cost
of very little money and time.</p>

<p>Naturally, the first thing to be made
is the stage. This must depend very
much upon the Marionettes you intend
to work. As a convenient size, suppose
you decide upon figures 8 inches in
height. This means that the frontage of
the stage must be about 28 inches wide
by 16 inches high, whilst it will run back
to a depth of some 14 inches.</p>

<p>Make a base of plain wood, 42 inches
by 22 inches. If more convenient this
can be made in two pieces, each 21 inches
by 22 inches. These fit together flush
and are held by a couple of hooks and
nails fastening beneath. Glue a block of
wood at each corner to form a support,
as shown in <a href="#Fig41_1">Fig. 1</a>, which depicts the
under side of the base. A, B are the
two hooks and nails; C, C, C, C are the above-mentioned blocks.
At a distance of 2 inches from what will be the front, and 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches from either end, cut a mortice in each piece of the base
(D, D in the figure), through which the tenons of the stage front
will project. They must, therefore, be made to suit the thickness of the
wood employed. At a distance of 5 inches from the back make<span class="pagenum" id="Page355">[355]</span>
four mortices, a couple in each part of the base as E, E, E, E in
the figure. These will serve to hold the rear of the stage.</p>

<p>The front of the stage is now constructed as indicated by <a href="#Fig41_2">Fig. 2</a>.
Two pieces must be made exactly similar to one another, each to
form one-half of the front. The
tenon, D, should be long enough
to pass through the mortice made
for it in the base, and project from
the other side sufficiently to allow
of a peg being pushed through a
hole bored in it. This peg will
serve to maintain the upright front
in place. Furthermore, two hooks
must be placed upon one of the
halves, to fasten to corresponding
nails in the other half, thus holding
the pieces of the stage front
firmly together.</p>

<p>The back of the stage consists of
two pieces of wood each 18 inches by
18 inches, having tenons to fit into the mortices below the pegs, and
fastened together by hooks and nails. Before proceeding further with
the work, bore two
holes, of sufficient size
to hold a piece of stout
copper wire firmly in
each piece of the base
(P, P, P, P, <a href="#Fig41_1">Fig. 1</a>).
The use of these will be
explained shortly.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig41_2">

<img src="images/illo355a.png" alt="" width="350" height="348" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Construction of front of stage.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The actual fabric of
the stage is now complete.
Bear in mind no
string or wire should
extend from the front
to the back of the stage,
for the simple reason
that these spaces must
be left perfectly clear to
allow of the exit and entrance
of the puppets.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig41_3">

<img src="images/illo355b.png" alt="" width="350" height="313" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Stage front completed.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Next fix the drapery in the form of curtains to each side of the
stage front. These must be chosen according to your own taste, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page356">[356]</span>
should harmonize with the exterior decoration of the theater. The
curtains should be gathered up and tacked to the stage front from the
inside, as in <a href="#Fig41_3">Fig. 3</a>, from which an idea of the general adornment of
the whole theater can be gleaned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Movable Curtain</span></h3>

<p>The following plan will be found very suitable for the arrangement
of the movable curtain. Take a piece of strong copper wire
and bend it, as shown
in <a href="#Fig41_4">Fig. 4</a>. The length
of the unbent portion
should be about 30
inches. Fit the two
ends, A and B, into
holes bored in the stage
front, inside and above the opening. The wire rod will thus run the
whole length of the actual stage, whilst the ends A and B suffice
to clear the fixed curtains already tacked up. Hang the movable
curtains by a number of little rings upon this rod. When drawn, the
two curtains, which should be of some stout material, will completely
cover the stage.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig41_4">

<img src="images/illo356a.png" alt="" width="400" height="113" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Wire rod for movable curtain.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The method of drawing the curtains is arranged thus: A string
(L, <a href="#Fig41_5">Fig. 5</a>) is passed through the loop C in the rod, through all the
rings from G4 to G, where it is fastened, and then passed on
through H and all those rings up to the loop D. The string L
then returns through the H rings 4 to 1 to H itself, where it is
fastened and ends. By pulling the string L when the curtain is
drawn, the ring H is therefore drawn towards D and the ring G
towards C, thus opening the curtains simultaneously by means of only
one string.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig41_5">

<img src="images/illo356b.png" alt="" width="600" height="154" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Arrangement for drawing curtains.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig41_6">

<img src="images/illo357.png" alt="" width="250" height="180" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Frame for wings.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Supposing the curtains to be now pulled right back, thread another
string, M, through the loop E, pass it through all the G rings and
across to H, where it must be fixed. Then pass this string through
all the H rings, through the loop F, and back by way of H to the ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page357">[357]</span>
G, where it must be tied and end. It will now be found that by
pulling the string M, the rings G and H are drawn together. To avoid
any confusion, a distinctive mark
should be placed upon the ends L
and M of each string.</p>

<p>You must next bend a couple of
pieces of strong copper wire into the
shape depicted in <a href="#Fig41_6">Fig. 6</a>. The sides
A B and C D should measure 20
inches, whilst B C must be of such
a length that the ends A and D can
fit into the holes P P already bored
in the base. These pieces of wire
serve to support the wings, trees, or other stage arrangements as
occasion requires.</p>

<p>The stage is now complete, and will take to pieces and pack up
flat with no trouble or inconvenience of any kind.</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig41_7">

<img src="images/illo358a.png" alt="" width="300" height="369" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;A stage tree.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Interior Decoration</span></h3>

<p>The next questions that arise concern scenery. This depends
entirely upon the play to be performed. The floor of the stage must
be covered with suitable paper, or better still with a carpet. In the
arrangement of the wings and the scenery connected therewith, do
not forget that the spaces on each side must be left clear. Marionettes
cannot enter by doors, and a descent from the ceiling is not only
undignified but impracticable. The side scenery must therefore be
as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Unless your performance is to be upon a very extensive scale, the
actual amount of scenery required is not great. An interior can easily
be painted. Pieces representing the walls of the room can be hung
upon what may be called the wing wires, whilst the rest of the interior
can be painted upon the stage back.</p>

<p>In all probability a rural scene will also be required. A stage
tree or two (<a href="#Fig41_7">Fig. 7</a>) should be fastened to the wing wires, and the
background of sky and landscape need present no difficulty to a handy
amateur. Street scenes can be arranged by hanging the ends and
fronts of houses from the wing wires, whilst the background may
either depict the street fading into the distance, or have another
house at the corner, after the fashion of stageland. A great variety
of scenery may be made with the help of an artistic friend; and
when at the theater, inspect the effects closely. By doing this many
invaluable hints as to setting and scenic inventions can be acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page358">[358]</span></p>

<p>But what is a theater without the actors? Who are to perform
upon the boards you have so carefully
constructed?</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned
that the Marionettes are to be about
8 inches high. This will be found
a convenient size for the beginner,
since very small figures are apt to
be troublesome, and large ones are
sure to prove unwieldly. It is important
to have the Marionettes so
articulated that they will readily
answer every motion of the operator&#8217;s
strings, and be neither too stiff
nor too limp.</p>

<div class="figleft w150" id="Fig41_8">

<img src="images/illo358b.png" alt="" width="150" height="344" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Dutch doll for
puppet.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Home-made Figures</span></h3>

<div class="figright w200" id="Fig41_9">

<img src="images/illo358c.png" alt="" width="200" height="195" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;Universal
arm-joint.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The following hints will show how
the figures are to be made at home at slight cost.
Get an ordinary Dutch doll (similar to that shown
in <a href="#Fig41_8">Fig. 8</a>) of the proper size and neatly made.
Notice that the hip-joints allow the legs to move
upwards freely, a convenience that the ordinary
doll lacks. The knee-joints are after the same
pattern, and allow the lower part of the leg to
double up for sitting and kneeling. These joints
should be made to work easily and evenly.</p>

<p>The arms should be attached to the body by
what is known as a universal joint
(seen in <a href="#Fig41_9">Fig. 9</a>). Make the surface
A B (<a href="#Fig41_10">Fig. 10</a>) perfectly even, and
then scoop a slight hollow in the
wood. In this hollow drive a staple
almost up to the head, leaving only
enough room to insert a piece of
string in the loop, whilst the head
of the staple is level with the surface
A B. Round off the end of the arm
(<a href="#Fig41_11">Fig. 11</a>), and pierce a hole about half-an-inch from the end. Thread
a piece of string through the staple and through the hole in the arm,
tying the ends together fairly tightly, so that the arm is perfectly
free at the joint but does not hang loosely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page359">[359]</span></p>

<p>For the head, either touch up the original Peggy&#8217;s head to make
it respectable, or remove it altogether, replacing it by that of a china
doll. In the former case, a flaxen wig must be glued over the black
painted hair, and a human complexion given to the
crimson cheeks. Undoubtedly a better effect is produced
by exchanging heads with a china sister.</p>

<p>The dressing of the Marionettes need be
a matter of no difficulty. The costumes must
depend entirely upon the nature of the play,
although certain stock characters may be
made once and for all, and kept in readiness.
A sailor, a soldier in resplendent uniform,
a policeman, and an ordinary man or two
can be kept prepared; whilst for the fair
sex, an old lady, a young one, a maid-servant,
and a little girl are likely to be of service. The remainder of
your cast must be regulated by circumstances. The clothing may be
fastened to the above-mentioned characters;
but in special cases the costumes
should be made to take off as occasion may
require.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Having prepared the figures, they must
now be made to act and move in a rational
manner.</p>

<p>Five black threads are attached to each
figure and ascend to the flies, where they
are manipulated by the performer. A
glance at <a href="#Fig41_12">Fig. 12</a> shows how and where
these threads are to be attached. Fix A
and B to the right and left hand respectively,
C and D to the knees, whilst E
must fasten to the back, where it serves
to support the figure. These threads
should be very fine, for the whole success
of your undertaking depends upon their
concealment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Working the Puppets</span></h3>

<div class="figleft w150" id="Fig41_13">

<img src="images/illo360.png" alt="" width="150" height="398" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;Finger
loops for manipulating
puppet.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>There are two methods of holding
the threads and working the puppets, the first of which is also
shown in <a href="#Fig41_12">Fig. 12</a>. The arm threads, A and B, are attached to
the end of a stick, F; the leg threads are similarly attached to<span class="pagenum" id="Page360">[360]</span>
another stick, G, to the center of which the body thread, E, is
fastened.</p>

<p>The sticks are then held, one in each hand, or both in the same.
Although more convenient for manipulation, this method possesses
the disadvantage of limiting each operator to the
management of one puppet, and where there are
several characters upon the stage, much confusion
may result. If the two sticks be held in one hand
free play, so far as pulling the strings is concerned,
is allowed to the fingers, and there should be no
difficulty in working two Marionettes at the same
time, one with each hand.</p>

<p>An easier method of manipulating the figures is
shown in <a href="#Fig41_13">Fig. 13</a>. The thread attachments are the
same, but instead of being fastened to sticks, each
string terminates in a brass ring placed upon the
finger. The threads should be of such a length that,
when the hand is held as in <a href="#Fig41_13">Fig. 13</a>, the body of the
puppet will be upright, the legs stretched, and the
arms dropped by the sides.</p>

<p>Place the rings upon the fingers in the following
order: The body string, E, to the third finger; the
leg strings, C and D, to the thumb and little finger;
and the arm threads to the first and second fingers, as shown in
<a href="#Fig41_13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>With very little practice the figures can be made to walk, the
progressive motion of the legs being manipulated by alternately moving
the thumb and little finger. A similar movement of the first and
second fingers will put the arms into action.</p>

<p>When sitting upon a chair, the lower parts of the legs bend by
their own weight, and you will need only to pull the body string to
make the figure rise quite naturally.</p>

<p>The theater, scenery and actors being ready, it remains to decide
what they shall play.</p>

<p>Your programme must necessarily be chosen according to the
audience. Presuming there is somebody to assist you in working
the figures, thereby making it possible to have three or four characters
upon the stage at once, the variety of plays is very great,
and the choice of one or two short pieces should be easy. Several
publishers issue large assortments of Marionette plays, and catalogues
can be obtained giving full particulars as to the number of characters
required, scenery necessary, and so forth.</p>

<p>The Marionette stage is not adapted to heavy drama. Tragedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page361">[361]</span>
would be ridiculous on the &#8220;two foot boards.&#8221; The r&ocirc;les, therefore,
assumed by each character should be amusing and topical, containing
allusions likely to be understood by the spectators, and interspersed
with such local &#8220;gags&#8221; as opportunity may suggest.</p>

<p>The two operators should divide their labors, as far as possible,
in such a way that the lady does the female characters, whilst
her partner works the men. The reason for this division is clear,
for it will come more natural for a lady to caricature the female
voice, whilst her accomplice will be better suited to the stern accents
of the menacing policeman, or the passionate entreaties of the ardent
lover.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Working</span></h3>

<p>Practice the parts carefully and thoroughly. Be ready with some
joke or patter to cover any mishap that may occur. Accidents are
unfortunate, but in Marionette-land quite probable, so if Aladdin&#8217;s
left arm fails to work at the critical moment, there is nothing to do
but make the audience think it all part of the fun.</p>

<p>Supposing the evening for your entertainment to have arrived,
and that all is in readiness, place the theater upon a table at such a
height that the spectators will get a clear view of the stage, but will
not be able to see the flies. The table should be against a wall, and
arranged in such a manner that you and your partner have sufficient
room to move behind it. In the space between the table and wall a
couple of boards must be placed on trestles, so that the operators may
stand above the stage.</p>

<p>A curtain must hang from the ceiling to meet the top of the
theater. On no account should the audience be able to watch the
heads of the manipulators moving the puppets. There are few better
plans than to have the stage arranged in the embrasure of a window,
for the curtain can then be easily contrived, whilst the &#8220;show&#8221;
does not take any of the space required for the spectators. But
this, of course, must depend upon the nature of the room at your
disposal.</p>

<p>The guests having been marshaled into their places, the entertainment
should open with an overture. If there be intervals in the course
of the play, the pianist will find fresh employment, whilst at times a
running accompaniment is very suitable.</p>

<p>Start with a one act farce, to be followed by a fairy tale or pantomime.
Conclude with another short farce, into which may be
introduced all kinds of whimsicalities, jokes, local patter, and topical
allusions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page362">[362]</span></p>

<p>The puppets will do exactly as you direct them. Make them work
their best; let the show be worth seeing and hearing, for the possibilities
of the Marionette stage are very great, and with ordinary care a most
enjoyable entertainment can be produced.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLII</b><br />
LIVING MARIONETTES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Good &#8220;One Man&#8221; Show</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A living</span> Marionette entertainment is well adapted for a &#8220;One Man
Show,&#8221; and sure to prove a success. The very appearance of the
weird creature, half human and half doll, makes the spectators laugh,
and this laugh will scarcely subside until
the curtain has been finally rung down
on the entertainment.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig42_1">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Front view of living
Marionette stage.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The mysterious combination shown
in <a href="#Fig42_1">Fig. 1</a> needs but little explanation,
since it is very
clear that the
head is human
whilst the body
is wooden. This
makes so comical
a figure that
anything but
pure humor
would seem singularly
out of
place issuing
from those lips;
it must, therefore,
be clearly understood that the living
Marionette is comic from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>The stage must be about 3 feet wide, and
of the same height, thus allowing room for
the head and false body. The stage front
may be made in the same manner adopted
for the Marionettes proper, though so much
space will not be required at the top, as can be seen from <a href="#Fig42_2">Fig. 2</a>.
The stage itself should be about 12 inches deep, and arranged at such<span class="pagenum" id="Page364">[364]</span>
a height that when standing behind, your chin will be about 11 inches
above the stage. The whole construction will then be somewhat like
the box and stage of an old-fashioned Punch
and Judy Show.</p>

<p>A strip of perfectly black cloth is next
stretched from side to side along the inner
edge of the stage, <i>i.e.</i> the part farthest removed
from the audience. This cloth should be 11
inches wide, and when
in place will occupy
the position shown in
<a href="#Fig42_3">Fig. 3</a>. Between this
edge of the stage and
the actual back of the
box should be a space
of 15 inches. The actual back must also be
covered with black cloth. The sectional appearance
of the stage will therefore be as in <a href="#Fig42_4">Fig. 4</a>.
An arrangement of curtains, as described in
connection with the Marionette stage, must be
fitted with the
strings below
the stage, in
order that you
may pull them
unseen by the
audience.</p>

<p>The wooden
bodies should be
10 inches high,
and headless. A
collar must be
sewn to the costume where the neck
should be, in order to conceal the spot
where the living head is thrust over the
false body.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory way of working
the limbs of the puppet is as follows:
Above the stage, in the flies, a rod, upon
which are strung several brass rings, extends
from side to side (A, <a href="#Fig42_4">Fig. 4</a>).
Now the strings attached to the arms and legs pass up and through these
rings, whence they descend behind the cloth screen and are moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page365">[365]</span>
invisibly by the operator. As there is only one figure to work,
you can hold the arm threads in one hand, the leg threads in the
other, whilst the supporting body thread passes in a loop around
your neck. In this way the body is forced to move with the living
head, as though really a part of it (<a href="#Fig42_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>You should now make up your face to suit the character.
Suppose the body represents an ordinary Jack Tar, with bell-bottomed
trousers, blue collar, and so forth. The comic sailor&#8217;s beard must be
so adjusted that its bushiness will conceal what may be called the
junction between your head and his false body. The hat or round
cap can be put on at a nautical tilt.</p>

<p>Having fixed the body-thread around your throat and fastened the
beard, crane your own neck forward, and place the Marionette body
upon the stage, having the strip of black cloth between it and your
shoulders. Arrange the arm and leg strings through the rings, and
keep the ends in your hands ready for action. When everything is
completed, draw the curtain and commence.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Comical Effects</span></h3>

<p>Songs and monologues are naturally the best turns for the Living
Marionette. Choose a rollicking, nautical song, suitable to Jack
Tar. All the gestures and motions can be given to the limbs by
means of the threads, whilst every now and again Jack can enliven
himself and the audience by executing a hornpipe. A little practice
with the leg-strings will enable you to perform this with great effect.</p>

<div class="figleft w150" id="Fig42_3">

<img src="images/illo364a.png" alt="" width="150" height="140" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Black cloth arrangement

body.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Always strive to obtain comical effects. If the gallant mariner
has a telescope in his hand, this should be raised to the eye, where
the extraordinary contrast between the tiny hand holding a midget
telescope, and the enormous face emerging from its forest of beard,
is ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

<p>Or if the other branch of the Service be on the boards, the cavalryman
may flourish a saber, which, at full arm&#8217;s length, will scarcely
reach the tip of his ear. A tiny rifle raised to the shoulder makes
another laughable effect.</p>

<p>The Man about Town is a humorous figure. Dressed in an
exaggeration of the latest style, with a dapper strut, flourishing a
modish cane, he is a person to be admired&mdash;and laughed at. Over
the pigmy body looms an enormous face, smoking a huge cigar,
big even for an ordinary individual. Naturally it would be impossible
to sing or speak with the cigar in his mouth, and it cannot be
gracefully removed with dummy hands that will scarcely reach it.
The simplest method of getting the cigar out of the way is to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page366">[366]</span>
&#8220;Bertie&#8221; stumble over his own cane, for instance, and in the agitation
of the moment drop his &#8220;smoke.&#8221; He will then be able to air his
peculiarities in comfort, and will prove a most amusing personage.</p>

<p>Two figures may be introduced upon the stage, although they
are likely to prove a tight fit. Some laughable dialogues and duets
are the result. Quarrels or love scenes must be intensely funny.
A young gentleman and a younger lady can be introduced with
much formality, and, advancing to shake hands, meet with an
embarrassing adventure, pleasant enough in its way. Owing to the
smallness of their arms and the largeness of their faces, before their
hands have met, their lips have perforce sealed the contract of
friendship.</p>

<p>A general idea of Living Marionettes and their working may
be gained from the foregoing suggestions. Sentimental songs, sung
with a whimsical air of grotesque pathos, will probably &#8220;bring the
house down,&#8221; whilst the applause attending a good comic song in
character will encourage all parties concerned.</p>

<p>Living Marionettes are sometimes introduced in conjunction with
an ordinary Marionette show, and should be given after the latter
has concluded. The contrast between the symmetrical little mannikins
and the distorted living doll will be remarkable, whilst the exuberant
humor of the latter is sure to provide a pleasant finale to what all
will judge a delightful evening.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLIII</b><br />
A HOME CIRCUS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A New Form of Entertainment</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A home circus</span> has so far been beyond the wildest dreams of the amateur
showman. Yet when one considers the wide scope a circus presents
to performers of every type, it is curious that &#8220;amateur circuses&#8221; are
not almost as popular as &#8220;amateur theatricals.&#8221; At first sight such a
show seems impracticable, on account of the large floor area required
for the ring. This need
occupy but little more
space than a stage, however;
and, taking into
consideration the fact
that the audience almost
completely surrounds the
performers, it will ultimately
be found that a
circus does not necessitate
so large a room as
might be anticipated.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig43_1">

<img src="images/illo367.png" alt="" width="450" height="248" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Showing barricade and ring entrance.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Of premier importance, of course, is the ring itself. It need not
be more than fifteen feet in diameter; but if additional space can be
spared, so much the better.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig43_1">Fig. 1</a> gives a plan of a ring. It principally consists of a circular
barricade about 30 inches high. In one portion there is a gap of
four or five feet, which acts as an entrance (A, <a href="#Fig43_1">Fig. 1</a>). If the ring
can be so arranged that a door of the room in which the circus is
being constructed, coincides with this entrance, much trouble will be
saved. Should this be impossible, however, two or three screens can
be arranged to form a passage from the ring entrance to the nearest
door.</p>

<p>The method of constructing the barricade is explained in <a href="#Fig43_2">Fig. 2</a>.
A number of broomsticks are sawn into 30 inch lengths and fixed
to heavy wooden bases in order that they may stand firmly upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page368">[368]</span>
floor. A hole is then bored in the other extremity; this may be done
by means of a red-hot meat skewer.</p>

<p>The position selected for the ring must next be marked out in
chalk, and the wooden stands placed round it at intervals of about a
yard. Then thread a piece of stout cord through the holes in the
extremities of the uprights.</p>

<p>Having determined the exact circumference of the ring, purchase a
sufficient length of cheap
red flannelette to go completely
round it. The cost
of this material should be
about 10 cents per yard,
and its width exactly equal
to the height of the stands.
A number of large hooks
must be obtained from the same shop, and sewn along one edge of
the flannelette. It remains only to hook the material to the cord, as
shown in <a href="#Fig43_2">Fig. 2</a>, in order to complete the barricade.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig43_2">

<img src="images/illo368a.png" alt="" width="500" height="154" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Construction of barricade.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The entrance must now be artistically draped with curtains, after
the style of A, <a href="#Fig43_1">Fig. 1</a>. It will then serve the additional purpose of a
&#8220;stage,&#8221; upon which conjurers, jugglers, and other artists who do not
wish the audience to see the back of their apparatus can perform.</p>

<p>The vexed question of &#8220;lights&#8221;&mdash;always a difficult problem in
amateur theatricals&mdash;need not here be considered, the gas or electric
fixtures already installed being sufficient.</p>

<p>A circus is never complete without its horses, so attention must
now be paid to this
department. It is
hardly practicable to
turn several full-grown
animals loose
in a circus constructed
in an ordinary
room nor is
it probable that the
reader&#8217;s purse will
run to the importation
of one or two
Shetland ponies.
But a whole stud of &#8220;circus horses&#8221; may be obtained at small expense
by carrying out the following directions.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig43_3">

<img src="images/illo368b.png" alt="" width="400" height="228" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Showing outline of horse and part to be stitched.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Purchase three yards of cotton cloth, at 6 cents per yard. Fold the
material in the center, thus making a double piece 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
yards long. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page369">[369]</span>
a pencil or piece of chalk sketch the outlines of the head and back of
a horse upon it, as shown in <a href="#Fig43_3">Fig. 3</a>. Then take a pair of scissors and
carefully cut out the stuff. The result will be two horse-shaped pieces
of calico of exactly similar proportions.</p>

<p>At this stage, if the young showman is wise, he will place the operations
in the hands of his mother or sister, for the two patterns must be
stitched together along the edges, to the points marked A and B,
<a href="#Fig43_3">Fig. 3</a>. This done, the whole affair should be turned inside out.</p>

<p>Next obtain a quantity of rags or shavings, or purchase some
excelsior from an upholsterer&#8217;s, and stuff first the head and then the
haunches of the &#8220;horse.&#8221; The two unsewn pieces of cloth in the center
remain empty. One of them must be cut in half, and the two sections
thus obtained folded and stitched into the form of two small bolsters and
stuffed with flock (A, B, <a href="#Fig43_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig43_4">

<img src="images/illo369.png" alt="" width="500" height="259" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Opening in horse for rider; tapes at A and B to be tied.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The remaining side should be similarly treated, only in this case it
must not be cut in half, but remain intact. The result will be the
head and haunches of a horse, with two &#8220;sausage-shaped&#8221; flanks in
the center (<a href="#Fig43_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Decorations</span></h3>

<p>The &#8220;noble thorough-bred&#8221; is now ready for its final decorations.</p>

<p>Unravel some coarse rope and sew it along the neck of the horse
to represent the mane. Another piece, unraveled at one end only,
does duty for a tail. The ears are constructed by cutting a piece of
calico, folded in the form of a sugar bag, perpendicularly down the
center, and stitching the two halves into position on the head.</p>

<p>The color of the horse must next be determined. If dapple-gray,
a few ink blobs upon the white background will suffice; but if chestnut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page370">[370]</span>
brown, or black, a distemper must be applied with a thick brush.
This distemper can be made by mixing ordinary water color, of the
shade required, with size water, and thickening with whiting.</p>

<p>When the distemper is dry, the &#8220;rider&#8221; of the horse must get into
the hollow in the center, and secure it to his hips by tying the tapes
together at A, B, <a href="#Fig43_4">Fig. 4</a>. A &#8220;valance&#8221; of cretonne should then be
sewn completely round the horse to hide the &#8220;rider&#8217;s&#8221; legs (<a href="#Fig43_5">Fig. 5</a>).
A pair of reins, and two dummy legs stitched on the flanks complete
the &#8220;mount.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig43_5">

<img src="images/illo370.png" alt="" width="450" height="551" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Ready for the tournament.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It will be noticed that in <a href="#Fig43_5">Fig. 5</a> the &#8220;rider&#8221; has a short skirt at
the waist of his coat or armor. This is to hide the manner in which
the horse is attached to the &#8220;rider&#8217;s&#8221; hips, and the junction of the
dummy legs.</p>

<p>These horses can be used in numerous ways. A very effective
item in which they might be employed is a &#8220;tilting scene.&#8221; Two
knights attired in armor&mdash;this latter commodity can be easily constructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page371">[371]</span>
as it consists simply of back- and breast-plates made from
painted cardboard, with a helmet of the same material&mdash;&#8220;canter&#8221;
into the ring. A clown follows them, also mounted, and carrying
two long poles upon the ends of which are pads of rag, one covered
with soot and the other with flour.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig43_6">

<img src="images/illo371.png" alt="" width="450" height="442" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Dummy horse for bareback rider.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The clown then proposes that they shall have a tournament, and
offers to act as referee. He thereupon hands them the poles, and,
holding them as they would lances, the knights retire to opposite sides
of the ring. At a signal from the clown, the combatants dash towards
each other, to commence the attack. The self-constituted referee gets
in the way, however, and comes in for a lot of hustling. The knights
again retire, and once more advance to the attack. But, as before,
the clown becomes mixed up in the affray. This occurs again and
again. Finally the two principals lose their temper and make a joint
attack upon the referee. Pursued by the irate knights, the clown
dashes round and round the ring, making his horse gallop first backwards,
then sideways, and perform other ludicrous capers. At length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page372">[372]</span>
daubed with soot and flour from the knights&#8217; &#8220;lances,&#8221; he darts precipitately
from the ring.</p>

<p>There is another style of &#8220;horse&#8221; shown in <a href="#Fig43_6">Fig. 6</a>. The carcase
is made in a manner similar to that already described, but in this case
the stuffing must be replaced by two men or boys, who crouch in
the position illustrated in the diagram. It will be necessary, however,
slightly to stuff the &#8220;horse&#8221; in such places as the head and haunches,
in order to make it of correct shape.</p>

<p>The two men or boys must carry upon their backs an oval-shaped
piece of board, having four &#8220;legs&#8221; nailed to its side, by means of
which the carriers hold it firmly in position during the performance.
This is clearly shown in <a href="#Fig43_6">Fig. 6</a>. The purpose of the board is to make
a flat and solid surface upon which the &#8220;daring bareback rider&#8221; can
perform.</p>

<p>The performance consists of jumping over garlands and through
hoops; leaping on to the back of the &#8220;horse&#8221; whilst it is at full
gallop, and other of the more simple feats seen at circuses.</p>

<p>It is preferable, however, that the &#8220;bareback rider&#8221; should be
a clown, who, instead of jumping the garlands, trips over them, and
falls headlong to the ground, completely misses the horse when attempting
to leap upon its back, and lands on the ringmaster instead,
thus making a travesty of the whole affair.</p>

<p>The next performance should be of a more serious nature.</p>

<p>Among the reader&#8217;s acquaintances is sure to be one who goes in
for gymnastics, and he should be prevailed upon to give an exhibition
of his prowess upon the parallel bars, these being preferable to any
other apparatus on account of the small space they occupy. To
increase the interest of the display, a clown should attempt to emulate
each movement as it is performed, but must fail miserably and come
a &#8220;cropper&#8221; every time. It is advisable to have a set of mattresses
to soften any unpremeditated falls.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How is it Done?</span></h3>

<p>Another item suitable for the programme of the home circus is
a &#8220;mock&#8221; conjuring entertainment. The ring-master announces
that Herr Bluffemstein, the famous illusionist, will present his marvelous
performance. Thereupon one of the boys or young men taking
part in the circus must stalk majestically into the ring, and bow stiffly
to the audience. If possible he should be attired in evening dress.
He should also wear a fierce, upturned mustache, and carry an air-gun
under his arm. A large target is then placed in the curtained
entrance to the ring. This target consists merely of a wooden board<span class="pagenum" id="Page373">[373]</span>
containing several bent nails, upon which lighted candles are stuck.
Below each candle a large number is painted (<a href="#Fig43_7">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Bluffemstein&#8221; then requests the audience to call out one
of these numbers. Upon their complying, he loads the air-gun, raises
it to his shoulder, takes aim, fires&mdash;and the lighted candle over
the chosen number goes out!
He repeats this marvelous feat
of marksmanship several times.
Then, without warning, the remaining
candles are suddenly
extinguished one by one, and a
voice exclaims: &#8220;I say, mister,
how much longer are you going to
keep me blowing out these lights?&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment a boy,
wearing a glaring red wig, steps
from behind the target, where he
has been engaged in blowing out
the candles through small holes bored exactly level with the wicks.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig43_7">

<img src="images/illo373.png" alt="" width="400" height="306" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Target for trick shooting.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>After admonishing his assistant for having &#8220;given the game
away,&#8221; the conjurer tells him to fetch the apparatus for the next
trick. The boy retires, but shortly reappears with a tin kettle and a
jug of water. &#8220;Herr Bluffemstein&#8221; then proceeds to fill the kettle
with water. Having done so, he holds it over his assistant&#8217;s head. A
few seconds pass, then steam is seen to be issuing from the spout!</p>

<p>The illusionist hands the kettle to his assistant, with instructions
to take it away and fetch something else. The boy, however, lifts off
the lid, and placing his hand into the interior, draws out a piece of
wire to which is attached a smoldering ball of brown paper.</p>

<p>The conjurer, enraged at thus having his second trick spoilt, chases
his assistant round the ring. He at length gives up the chase as
hopeless, and entices him to proceed with the next trick. The boy
again leaves the ring; but soon returns with a slate, a slip of ordinary
writing-paper, a wet sponge, and a piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>The latter requires a little preparation before being used. The
conjurer and his assistant must fix upon a certain number&mdash;say
21&mdash;and write it reversely on the brown paper with a thick piece of
chalk. This, of course, must be done &#8220;behind the scenes,&#8221; and the
assistant should be careful that the audience do not catch sight of the
figures when he enters the ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Bluffemstein&#8221; takes the slip of white paper, and hands it in
turn to three people sitting in different parts of the room, with the
request that each shall write a certain number upon it without letting<span class="pagenum" id="Page374">[374]</span>
him know what has been written. Whilst they are thus engaged he
wipes the slate with the wet sponge, and proceeds to wrap it in the
brown paper, taking care that the chalked figures come in contact with
the middle of the slate. Placing the parcel on the ground, he orders
his assistant to stand upon it. The pressure thus applied will, of
course, print the chalked figures on to the slate.</p>

<p>The conjurer then takes the paper from the member of the audience
who last wrote upon it. Handing it to the boy, he instructs him
to add up the figures, and read out the result. The boy pretends to
make the addition, but in reality calls out the number previously
decided upon.</p>

<p>When the slate is unwrapped the audience are amazed to perceive
the apparently correct figures chalked upon it. But before their
astonishment has had time to abate, the assistant whips up the brown
paper, and displaying the chalked figures to the audience, exclaims:
&#8220;Why, sir, there&#8217;s still a lot more chalk to come off! And do you
know I nearly forgot the number I was told to call out?&#8221;</p>

<p>There are numerous other tricks than can be adapted in the above
manner, but space will not permit further examples to be given. It
is a good plan to finish up with a really first-class illusion, such as</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Indian Sack Trick</span></h3>

<p>In this illusion the assistant brings forward a sack and proceeds
to get into it. The conjurer then seizes the top of the sack, and pulls
it right over the boy&#8217;s head. Producing a piece of rope, he requests
some one in the audience so to tie the mouth of the sack that it will
be impossible for the assistant to get out.</p>

<p>When this is done, the conjurer places a screen round the boy,
and slowly counts &#8220;One, two, three!&#8221; As he utters the last word,
he pulls away the screen. The assistant is then seen to be perfectly
free, with the sack slung carelessly across his shoulder. When the
sack is examined it is found to be still securely tied with the identical
knot made by the member of the audience.</p>

<p>The explanation lies in the fact that two sacks are employed. The
assistant has one secreted up his coat, and as the conjurer pulls the
first sack over his head, the boy carefully pushes the top of the other
through its mouth. The conjurer hides the junction between the two
by gathering the material together in his hand&mdash;apparently with the
intention of making it more easy to tie. Consequently the member
from the audience unconsciously ties the mouth of the second sack
instead of the first. All that is necessary for the assistant to do,
therefore, when the screen is placed round him is to scramble out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page375">[375]</span>
first sack, stuff it up his coat out of sight, then sling the other carelessly
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Juggling is another performance eminently suitable for a show such
as the home circus. The only juggling the average person is capable
of, however, consists in balancing a stick upon his finger, or keeping a
couple of balls in motion. But the few hints given below will make it
possible for any one to give a trick juggling performance after a few
hours&#8217; practice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Trick Juggling</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Fig43_8">Fig. 8</a> shows the first feat&mdash;that of balancing a stick, card, and
wooden ball upon the hand. The whole secret lies in the card. It
really consists of two cards pasted together, with a piece of wire
passing diagonally between them and protruding about half an inch at
each end. In both the ball and stick are small holes into which this
wire fits. The audience, of course, must be kept in ignorance of this&mdash;not
a difficult thing to do when several feet separate them from the
performer.</p>

<div class="split5050">

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The feat depicted in <a href="#Fig43_9">Fig. 9</a> consists in balancing two balls upon a
stick. This is done by means of a wire constructed to slide up and
down in the center of the stick. At first this wire is completely
hidden, but by pushing up the small handle the performer can make
it protrude from the extremity of the stick, and pass through small<span class="pagenum" id="Page376">[376]</span>
holes in the balls. Of course, other objects may be made to balance
by this device.</p>

<p>The juggler should also number amongst his apparatus several
cardboard plates of the pattern shown by the three diagrams comprising
<a href="#Fig43_10">Fig. 10</a>. A segment must first be cut from a circular piece of
cardboard, as shown by A. The edges of this segment should then be
gummed together, the result being the conical contrivance seen in B.
Lastly, a circular cardboard ring must be fixed to the edge of this
cone, C, and the plate is complete. It is quite an easy matter to impart
a spin to these plates as they are thrown into the air, and then
catch them on the end of a stick, where they will rapidly revolve without
the possibility of falling.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><a href="#Fig43_11">Fig. 11</a> shows a method whereby a billiard ball can be made to
roll along the edge of a fan. A piece of wire is hinged to the bottom
of the fan, the other end protruding
about one-eighth of an inch beyond
the edge. The billiard ball, which is
partly pierced by a small hole, fixes
upon this wire. If the performer
then places his forefinger in the small ring made in the wire, and
works it slowly backward and forwards, the billiard ball will appear
to be rolling along the edge of the fan.</p>

<p>An excellent series of tricks may also be performed by means of a
pack of cards, having each card joined together by a thin piece of
twine in the manner shown by <a href="#Fig43_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page377">[377]</span></p>

<p>Numerous other devices can be adopted by the juggler, and the
suggestions offered above may be enlarged upon considerably. The
merest tyro in the &#8220;art of balancing&#8221; should thus be able to contribute
an excellent item to the home circus.</p>

<p>Every owner of a dog has taught his pet at some time or another
several little tricks. The manager of the circus should therefore get
those of his acquaintances who possess dogs to combine in contributing
to the programme.</p>

<p>Then, again, a big dog might be clothed in a &#8220;bull&#8217;s skin&#8221; made
from calico, and a farcical bull-fight arranged. Here the circus
&#8220;horses&#8221; could be once more employed to good purpose.</p>

<p>The &#8220;strong man&#8221; is a character always associated with circuses,
and there is no reason why the home circus should not possess one.
The weights must be made from wood, painted black to represent the
genuine article. After the &#8220;strong man&#8221;&mdash;who should be selected
from the most powerfully-built of the reader&#8217;s acquaintances&mdash;has
lifted the different &#8220;weights,&#8221; apparently with a great deal of exertion,
he makes his exit, leaving them upon the ground. A little boy
then enters, and picking up all the &#8220;weights,&#8221; walks unconcernedly
from the ring.</p>

<p>As has been before mentioned, the home circus presents scope for
almost every kind of amateur performance, but it must be left to the
ingenuity of the reader to give further variety and make the programme
as attractive as possible.</p>

<p>As a grand finale, a stirring, spectacular sketch should be given&mdash;such
as an attack upon a settler&#8217;s hut by redskins, or a raid on the
shanty of a miner. The main idea in this sketch must be to make a
lot of noise, blaze away with toy pistols at frequent intervals, and
burn as much &#8220;colored fire&#8221; as possible. The soldiers or mounted
police should arrive in the nick of time, of course, and drive the
marauders completely from the field. Thus everything ends quite
happily.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLIV</b><br />
HOW TO MAKE AND WORK A PEEP-SHOW</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Old Form of Entertainment Revived</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A peep-show</span> makes an excellent and quite novel form of home entertainment,
and a boy would be well repaid for any trouble to which
the construction of one might put him.</p>

<p>The first consideration is the dimensions of the show. One can
be large enough to occupy
the whole of a table, or so
small that it can be made
from a soap or cigar box.
The best course, therefore,
will be to leave the question
of size to the reader.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig44_1">Fig. 1</a> is an illustration
of the peep-show when
finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig44_1">

<img src="images/illo378.png" alt="" width="400" height="555" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;The finished show.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The first requisite is a
wooden box of the shape
shown in <a href="#Fig44_2">Fig. 2</a>. As previously
mentioned, for a
small show a cigar box
does admirably. If you
visit a friend who has just
commenced smoking, and
ask him for a box, he will
most likely bless you for the
opportunity you have given
him of throwing away his
horribly strong cigars.
Should no such friend be
numbered amongst your
acquaintances, however, a tobacconist will be pleased to let you have
one for a cent or so.</p>

<p id="Ref10">Having obtained the box, commence operations upon it. First<span class="pagenum" id="Page379">[379]</span>
of all one end must be entirely removed, not a very difficult task
to accomplish. The next thing to do is to make the peep-holes.
There is no fixed size for these. They may be large enough for both
eyes to be applied, or to permit only one to gaze through. But
provided they are of sufficient dimensions to allow the &#8220;audience&#8221;
to obtain a comprehensive
view of the interior that is
all that is required.</p>

<p>The number of peep-holes
must, of course, be
regulated by the size of the
show.</p>

<p>If the reader possesses
a fretsaw the making of the
holes will present no difficulty.
The best method to
be adopted by those who
have not one of these useful
instruments, is to make
small holes in the necessary
places with a red-hot poker.
They can then be easily
whittled to the desired size
with a penknife, the edges being finished off with a piece of emery
paper. Should the reader wish to make his show &#8220;extra smart,&#8221;
he can putty a piece of glass inside the box over the holes. But
this is not essential.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig44_2">

<img src="images/illo379.png" alt="" width="400" height="360" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Showing back view of stage front and

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig44_3">

<img src="images/illo380a.png" alt="" width="200" height="244" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Candle stand and roof
protector.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Next obtain a piece of cardboard, and from it cut out a stage
front to fit the interior of the box, as shown in <a href="#Fig44_2">Fig. 2</a>. This front
must be painted in bright colors and glued inside the box about
3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches from the end opposite to that at which the peep-holes have
been made.</p>

<p>The dotted lines in the illustration of the finished show (<a href="#Fig44_1">Fig. 1</a>)
indicate the position of this stage front. A reference to the same
diagram will also show a small door at the side of the show (D, <a href="#Fig44_1">Fig. 1</a>).
This must next claim our attention.</p>

<p>Simply cut a small aperture about 3 inches wide by 4 inches deep,
and hinge the oblong of wood thus obtained back into its position
by means of a piece of linen and glue. The object of this door is to
enable the showman to attend to the lighting of his show, done by
means of a candle, or, if necessary, two or three candles. The lights
are placed behind the stage front in such a position that they are
invisible to those gazing through the peep-holes. In order that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page380">[380]</span>
candles shall not scorch the roof, they should be placed upon pieces
of tin, bent to the shape shown in <a href="#Fig44_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>The first portion of the show is now
complete, and we will turn our attention
to the second, and more important
section.</p>

<p>Another raid must be made upon the
tobacconist&#8217;s or grocer&#8217;s and a second box
procured similar to the first. It is necessary
that this box should be of the same
width, and at least twice as high as the
first is deep.</p>

<p>This box is represented by B, <a href="#Fig44_1">Fig. 1</a>.
Stand it on end and place the other against
it in the manner shown by the diagram.
Now take a pencil and mark a line across
the second box at its junction with the first.
With a fretsaw or penknife make a cut along
this line, and then completely remove the square of wood below
this cut. A glance at <a href="#Fig44_4">Fig. 4</a> will
make this clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300" id="Fig44_4">

<img src="images/illo380b.png" alt="" width="300" height="461" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Scene-raising apparatus.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The back of the box must be
taken off and hinged on again in
the form of a door. This is to
enable the youthful showman
easily to execute repairs if anything
&#8220;goes wrong with the
works.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is now time to turn attention
to the most important portion
of the show&mdash;the scenes.</p>

<p>If the reader possesses any
artistic ability, he cannot do better
than paint them himself. A few
hints upon this subject will perhaps
be useful.</p>

<p>He must pay a visit to a
stationer&#8217;s, and purchase a supply
of white drawing-card, such as
is used by artists. A fair-sized
sheet costs only two cents. Having
procured this he must lightly
sketch, in pencil, the first scene upon it. If he be at all doubtful as<span class="pagenum" id="Page381">[381]</span>
to his artistic abilities, however, the following is an excellent plan
to adopt.</p>

<p>Armed with a pencil and piece of tracing-paper cut to the size
of the scenes, he should carefully examine the various illustrations
appearing in magazines. A short search should reveal a mountain,
a mass of foliage, a waste of sea, or some other subject suitable for
the background of the first scene. He must then get to work with
the pencil and trace this upon the tracing-paper. Another search
will bring to light something adaptable for the middle-distance. Lastly,
a group of objects for the foreground must be selected, and the whole
transferred first to the tracing-paper and thence to the drawing-card.
Thus by taking a background from one illustration and a foreground
from another, almost any scene may be built up.</p>

<p>After being sketched-in in pencil the scenes must be colored.
This should be done with a view to general effect rather than perfect
detail. First the predominant
colors should be laid on in a bold
wash, then the objects in the background
painted in. The coloring
must be as vivid as possible, in fact,
almost gaudy.</p>

<p>Instead of each scene representing
a single incident, it is preferable
to weave the whole series
into some sort of a narrative, such
as &#8220;A Voyage round the World,&#8221;
&#8220;With Shackleton to the South
Pole,&#8221; or, if the reader is very
imaginative, &#8220;Round the United
States in an Aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having procured the scenes&mdash;they
can number from half-a-dozen
to a score&mdash;proceed to fix them in
the show. <a href="#Fig44_5">Fig. 5</a> gives an interior
view of scene-raising apparatus.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig44_5">

<img src="images/illo381.png" alt="" width="350" height="451" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Interior view of scene-raising
apparatus.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A hole must first be bored in the center of each scene and pieces
of stout thread knotted in them. A series of diminutive wire-rings,
corresponding numerically to the number of scenes, must be fixed
into the roof of the box in the position indicated by the dots at A,
<a href="#Fig44_4">Fig. 4</a>. <a href="#Fig44_5">Fig. 5</a> shows position of wire-rings at A, B thread, and C
loop for scene-raising. The pieces of thread must be carried through
the rings at A, bent at right angles at B, and brought to the outside
of the box through a number of small holes (B, <a href="#Fig44_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page382">[382]</span></p>

<p>It will now be observed that when one of these threads is pulled,
the scene to which it is attached is lifted swiftly out of view of the
audience and behind the top portion of the box.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the scenes and threads becoming entangled
when raised and lowered, thin strips of wood should be glued up
either side of the box, thus making a series of grooves in which each
scene can work. In <a href="#Fig44_4">Fig. 4</a> the first scene has been raised, leaving one
of these grooves displayed to view.</p>

<p>Another reference to this diagram (C, <a href="#Fig44_4">Fig. 4</a>) will show a
number of small nails corresponding to the holes at B. When a scene
is pulled up, the wire-ring at the end of the thread can be slipped over
this nail, thus preventing its dropping down again.</p>

<p>It now remains only to put the two sections of the peep-show
together. This is easily done. Simply push one box firmly
against the other in the manner shown in <a href="#Fig44_1">Fig. 1</a>, and secure them
either by means of small brads or strong glue.</p>

<p>The whole contrivance can then be painted and decorated to
suit the taste of the young showman, and everything is ready for
the first &#8220;performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The showman lights his candles, places the show upon the table
in a convenient position, and gets his &#8220;audience&#8221; to look through
the peep-holes. Then he starts upon his description of the first
scene, making it as entertaining as possible by well padding with jokes.
When he has finished with the first scene&mdash;Zr-r-rip!&mdash;he pulls the
thread, the picture is whisked out of the audience&#8217;s view before they
quite realize what has happened, and the next scene is displayed.</p>

<p>Thus he will go through the whole series of pictures, and then&mdash;well,
after that, I trust he will be listening to the congratulations of
the audience upon his success as a peep-show man.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLV</b><br />
THE &#8220;MECHANICAL&#8221; PEEP-SHOW</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Secrets of Lightning Transformations</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another variety of peep-show well worthy of attention. It
is known as the &#8220;mechanical&#8221; peep-show. A short account of the
finished show will not be out of place before proceeding with a more
detailed description.</p>

<p>Upon looking through the peep-holes the interior of a cottage is
perceived, including side wings. The next moment, however, a faint
click is heard&mdash;and the interior of the cottage miraculously vanishes,
giving place to a scene in a forest glade!</p>

<p>The simplest and most satisfactory manner of explaining this marvelous
transformation is to describe how one of these &#8220;mechanical&#8221;
shows may be made.</p>

<p>Procure a wooden box similar to the first of those employed in
the manufacture of the previous show. Having decided upon the
number of peep-holes, cut them out in the manner <a href="#Ref10">already described</a>.
Another &#8220;stage front&#8221; must then
be fixed in position about 3 inches
from the peep-holes (<a href="#Fig45_1">Fig. 1</a>). For
the sake of convenience it is advisable
to turn the box upside down,
with the lid at the bottom instead
of the top. This will permit the
interior of the show being attended
to without unnecessarily disturbing
the mechanism.</p>

<p>Having, for the time being,
finished with the body of the peep-show,
turn your attention to the
internal parts. These are by no
means complicated.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig45_1">

<img src="images/illo383.png" alt="" width="350" height="315" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Handles and tin clip for holding
scenes.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>First obtain a piece of white drawing-card, and cut it to fit exactly
the back of the box. Then take another piece, half the size of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page384">[384]</span>
first, and hinge it by means of a strip of linen and gum to the center
as shown in A A, <a href="#Fig45_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>With the flap thus formed hanging downwards, place the card
upon the table, and proceed to paint thereon a forest scene (C, <a href="#Fig45_2">Fig. 2</a>).
If a suitable illustration can be procured from a magazine it will
only be necessary to paste
it on the card and carefully
trim the edges.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig45_2">

<img src="images/illo384a.png" alt="" width="400" height="329" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;A double-barreled scene.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Having satisfactorily
completed the forest scene,
bend the flap upwards,
thus hiding the picture,
leaving in its place a blank
piece of card. Brushes
and paints must again be
employed, and the blank
card transformed to the
interior of a cottage. The
result is the &#8220;double-barreled&#8221;
scene represented
by <a href="#Fig45_2">Fig. 2</a>. A
glance at this diagram
makes it apparent that by simply dropping down, or lifting up, the
hinged flap D, the scene can be changed at the will of the operator.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig45_3">Fig. 3</a> is an example of one of the wings employed in the show.
Like the scene, it is &#8220;double-barreled.&#8221; A strip of white cardboard
is the first requisite. Its size will be dependent
upon the dimensions of the show.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig45_3">

<img src="images/illo384b.png" alt="" width="200" height="324" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Part of double-barreled
wing.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Draw a line down the center of the card (<a href="#Fig45_3">Fig. 3</a>).
Then proceed to paint upon one side of this line a
section of a tree, or some other piece of forest
foliage (A, <a href="#Fig45_3">Fig. 3</a>). Having done this, turn the
card over and paint upon the reverse side a curtain,
window, or anything else suggesting a cottage
interior at B, <a href="#Fig45_3">Fig. 3</a>. This double wing must then
be carefully cut out in the manner shown.</p>

<p>Next take a piece of wood slightly longer than
the wing, and about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch wide by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch thick.
Glue this to the center of the wing as shown at C,
<a href="#Fig45_3">Fig. 3</a>. A closer reference to this diagram reveals
that the strip of wood is whittled to a point at E; also that a wire
&#8220;handle&#8221; is fixed to the other extremity, D. At present, however,
this &#8220;handle&#8221; should be held in reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page385">[385]</span></p>

<p>Three other wings have also to be made. <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a> suggests the
various forms they may take.</p>

<p>The segments of the show are now complete, and all that remains
is to put them together.</p>

<p>First take the hinged scene and fix it in the end of the box opposite
the peep-holes. To prevent
the flap falling down at an inopportune
moment and displaying
the wrong scene, a slit
must be made at the top of
the box and a small strip of
tin inserted (B, <a href="#Fig45_1">Fig. 1</a>). This
strip of tin is also shown at B,
<a href="#Fig45_2">Fig. 2</a>. It will be found that
when this is pushed down, it
clips on the flap D, holding it
against C.</p>

<p>On being pulled up, however,
the flap is released, and,
falling down, changes the picture.
To lift the flap again,
attach a piece of thread to one
corner, carrying the loose end out through a small hole in the back of
the box.</p>

<p>The wings should be placed in the interior of the show, in the
position illustrated by <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a>. The wooden point at the base of each
wing acts as a pivot in a small hole made in the bottom of the box.
Four corresponding holes must also be bored at the top.</p>

<p>The wire &#8220;handles&#8221; next claim attention. They should be pushed
through the small hole, as shown in <a href="#Fig45_1">Fig. 1</a>, and fixed firmly in each
wing. The holes must, in every case, be large enough to permit the
wings to revolve easily and with the least possible resistance.</p>

<p>Each &#8220;handle&#8221; is connected by a straight piece of wire having
both ends bent in the form of a small ring (G, <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a>). It will
also be noticed in this diagram that one of these &#8220;handles&#8221; has a
considerably longer shank than the others (H, <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a>). This is to
enable the showman to bring about the transformation previously
explained.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig45_4">

<img src="images/illo385.png" alt="" width="400" height="368" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Simultaneous revolving wings.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A glance at <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a> will make it apparent that when H is turned,
the four wings revolve also. Thus the wings for the forest scene may
be suddenly switched out of sight, and those for the interior of the
cottage displayed, or <i>vice versa</i>, at the will of the operator. To
prevent the wings revolving too far, a small block of wood should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page386">[386]</span>
nailed to the bottom of the box at the base of the first wing, in the
position shown by X, <a href="#Fig45_4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>The mechanical peep-show is now finished. After the showman
has grouped his audience at the peep-holes, and all is ready for the
transformation, he simply turns the wire handle with one hand, and
with the other simultaneously raises the clip securing the back scene.
All that is heard by those at the peep-holes is a faint click as the
wings revolve. Then they perceive, with no little bewilderment, that
in some inexplicable manner the interior of the show has been completely
changed. The showman will be wise to refrain from permitting
them further to examine the apparatus, however, for when they
realize the absurdly simple mechanism by which the transformation
is wrought, their bewilderment will vanish even more rapidly than do
the scenes themselves.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLVI</b><br />
HOW TO MAKE AND WORK A PUNCH AND
JUDY SHOW</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">His Highness of the Hump</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> and Mrs. Judy at one time held quite an exalted position
among forms of entertainment dear to the heart of the British boy.
As far back as the reign of Queen Anne, a well-known periodical
devoted quite a considerable space to a criticism of a Punch and Judy
performance!</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right3367-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split3367-->

<p>Moreover, in England, less than fifty years ago it was no unusual
occurrence for a traveling showman to hire a barn or large room and give
a whole evening&#8217;s performance with his Punch and Judy.</p>

<p>Punch is just as amusing indoors as out, and the boy who is interested
in giving different forms of home entertainment will find a
Punch and Judy an excellent addition to his other shows.</p>

<p>The stage upon which Mr. Punch performs his amusing antics
is simple of construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page388">[388]</span></p>

<p>It will first be necessary to procure six uprights, each 7 feet long
and 1 inch thick; and nine crosspieces each 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet long and 1 inch
thick.</p>

<p>Take a pair of uprights and join them together with three crosspieces&mdash;one
at each end and the other in the center. The result will
be a framework such as is shown in <a href="#Fig46_1">Fig. 1</a>. The four remaining
uprights must be similarly treated.</p>

<p>Altogether three frames will have been constructed, and they must
be hinged together, as shown in <a href="#Fig46_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig46_3">

<img src="images/illo388a.png" alt="" width="250" height="77" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The platform.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>This may be done with either strips of cloth or small metal hinges.
The latter may be purchased from any hardware store for a few
cents.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the framework has only three sides. The
fourth side is to be occupied by Punch&#8217;s platform, which merely
consists of a small board about 6
inches wide and 2 feet 6 inches
long. An oblong nick 1 inch by
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch should be cut in each side
of this platform, as shown both in
<a href="#Fig46_3">Fig. 3</a> and A, <a href="#Fig46_4">Fig. 4</a>. A cut of
similar dimensions must also be
made 5 feet 6 inches from the
ground in both the front uprights
of the framework (B, <a href="#Fig46_4">Fig. 4</a>). The
incisions in the platform dovetail into those in the uprights. To make
all quite secure two small catches (A, <a href="#Fig46_4">Fig. 4</a>) are fitted to the ends of
the platform, and these clamp round the uprights, holding everything
firmly in position.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Arrangement for supporting

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The framework is now complete, and with the exception of
the small space above Punch&#8217;s platform, should be covered with
dark red or green paper cambric, which may be purchased at five
or six cents a yard. The width of the cloth will be found just
over 2 feet 6 inches, <i>i.e.</i> the same width as a single frame. The
best course, therefore, will be to cut the cloth into seven-foot
lengths and nail it with small tacks or brads over each frame
separately.</p>

<p>The space below Punch&#8217;s platform, however, is covered in a different
manner.</p>

<p>A row of tacks or brads is driven into the front of the two uprights
to about three-quarters of their length. A corresponding number of
small curtain rings&mdash;to be obtained at any hardware store for 5 cents
a dozen&mdash;are then sewn down the sides of a piece of the cambric 5 feet
6 inches long. By this means the cloth may be hooked to the front
of the show, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig46_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Packing Up the Show</span></h3>

<p>When the Punch and Judy Show has to be packed away, it is
merely necessary to unhook the front cloth, take out the platform,
and fold the framework up as though it were
a screen or a clothes&#8217; horse.</p>

<p>But before this trial &#8220;pack up&#8221; is attempted,
there are one or two small but important additions
to be made.</p>

<p>First of all, the top of the opening at which
Punch presents his cheery countenance must
be decorated. This is easily done. Two small
nails are driven perpendicularly into the top of
the front uprights, and a stout piece of wire
stretched between them. A frieze of cambric is
then hemmed round the wire (<a href="#Fig46_5">Fig. 5</a>). The
wire should be simply hooked on the nails, so
that it can easily be detached when the show is
folded up.</p>

<p>A similar frieze must also be tacked along
the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>With regard to the scenery! Mr. Punch is very modest in this
direction, for he requires only two wings with which to garnish his
abode. These generally take the form of a scene of the top window
of a house, and the front of a shop or a portico.</p>

<p>The front and back of one of these wings are shown in <a href="#Fig46_6">Figs. 6</a>
and <a href="#Fig46_6A">6<i>a</i></a> respectively.</p>

<p>It consists merely of a framework of wood, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet long by
9 inches wide, over which a piece of white cardboard is nailed or
glued. The desired scene is then executed on the cardboard in either
oil paint, water color, or crayon.</p>

<p>The window itself should be cut completely out and hinged back
again with a strip of linen, so that Punch and the other characters
may poke their heads through (<a href="#Fig46_6A">Fig. 6<i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page390">[390]</span></p>

<p>The complete wings must then be hinged one on each side of the
show, as seen in <a href="#Fig46_7">Fig. 7</a>. In this diagram the wings are illustrated
as seen from the inside.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Puppets</span></h3>

<p>The &#8220;stage&#8221; is now complete, and it remains but to make the
grotesque little puppets that perform
upon it.</p>

<p>Pride of place must be given,
of course, to the redoubtable
Punch himself.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this
puppet to construct is the head.
There are very few boys skillful
enough to carve out the correct
features from an ordinary block
of wood; therefore they must find
some other foundation upon which
to work. A Dutch doll, to be
purchased at any toyshop for a
few cents, serves splendidly.
Whilst the reader is in the toyshop
buying the one doll, he may
as well extend his order to about
a dozen more; not only are they
useful for making Punch, but their stony countenances can be transformed
into those of Judy or any of the other characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page391">[391]</span></p>

<p>The dolls should all be decapitated, and have their hands and
feet removed as well. One of the heads must then be selected, and
the little snub nose taken off with a sharp knife. A semicircular
line should next be penciled right across the lower part of the
face, and all the wood below this line cut away to the depth of
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch or so (<a href="#Fig46_8">Fig. 8</a>). A &#8220;false&#8221; chin is to go here, whilst a
&#8220;false&#8221; nose must adorn the spot whence the original member was
removed.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Both nose and chin can be whittled from separate pieces of wood&mdash;the
doll&#8217;s discarded body will do. <a href="#Fig46_9">Fig. 9</a> shows the shape they
should assume. When both have been carved to the reader&#8217;s satisfaction,
they must be glued firmly in their respective positions, and
the joints hidden by a few judicious touches of the paint-brush.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig46_10">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Mr. Punch.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>In the case of the nose, a small tag of wood must be left, as
in <a href="#Fig46_9">Fig. 9</a>, and a hole bored in the head to receive it. This will
make the joint more secure than if it were simply glued, and as
Punch&#8217;s nose receives more than its fair share of knocks, the precaution
of having it firmly fixed is not altogether an unwarrantable
one.</p>

<p>The adjusting of the &#8220;false&#8221; nose and chin is by no means a
simple task, requiring, as it does, considerable ingenuity. But on the
whole it will be found much easier than having to carve the entire
face.</p>

<p>The clothing of Punch is best left in the hands of the reader&#8217;s
mother or sister. Although it is astonishing what a boy can do with
needle and thread when necessity puts him to the trial, making the
tiny suit of scarlet calls for an amount of patience and a carefulness
over detail that only a lady can be relied upon to exercise.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig46_10">Fig. 10</a> shows the pattern for Punch&#8217;s coat. The cloth selected
for the garment must be folded double, cut to the pattern given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page392">[392]</span>
then hemmed round the edges as indicated by the dotted lines. The
sleeves are made separately, being afterwards sewn into position on
the jacket.</p>

<p>When the reader&#8217;s mother or sister has finished the little scarlet
coat, Punch&#8217;s head must be glued by its neck
into the collar, a lace frill being afterwards
attached to finish off the joint neatly. The hands
from the Dutch doll should next be glued into
the sleeves, and smaller frills similarly attached.</p>

<p>Before the head is
stuck in position, however,
a hole must be bored
in the base of the neck
just large enough to
admit the tip of the
forefinger.</p>

<p>For Punch&#8217;s nether
garments two cylinders of
cloth only are necessary.
The feet from the Dutch doll must be glued into
one end of each cylinder, whilst the other ends
should be sewn individually inside the front of
the coat.</p>

<p>A conical hat must next be made, and either
glued or tacked to the head. After the hump
has been well stuffed with wadding, Punch
should have assumed an appearance similar to
that of the gentleman depicted in <a href="#Fig46_11">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Working the Figures</span></h3>

<p>To &#8220;work&#8221; the figures the performer first
puts his hand up the back of the coat, and sticks
the tip of his forefinger in the hole in the head. He then places his
thumb and second finger in the diminutive sleeves. By this means the
puppet can be made to fling his arms about, and move his head in a
most grotesque fashion.</p>

<p>The other puppets are constructed on practically the same lines;
but in the majority of cases it will be unnecessary to provide them
with knickerbockers and legs, as the audience see only the upper part
of the bodies above the platform. In these circumstances the attire
can take the form of a simple, long, loose gown, such as that worn by
the Clown in <a href="#Fig46_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page393">[393]</span></p>

for the Ghost.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Judy&#8217;s prepossessing features may be made from another of the
dolls&#8217; heads by substituting a beaked nose for the original organ.
The lady&#8217;s dress consists of a gown made
from some red spotted material.</p>

<p>By a judicious application of paint, and
by gluing on colored tufts of wood for
hair, the remaining heads can be transformed
into craniums suitable for the other puppets.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ghost</span></h3>

<p>The Ghost, however, may receive a little
special treatment. One of
the heads should be vividly
painted in black and white
to represent a skull. Then
attach it to a wooden stick,
decorated with a series of
black rings, as shown in
<a href="#Fig46_13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>The body consists of a
long white gown similar to
the other dresses, the only
difference being that the
head is left quite free in
the collar. When the mysterious visitor makes his
first appearance his head is right down upon his
shoulders, as in <a href="#Fig46_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>Directly Punch becomes too familiar, however, the
showman can make the Ghost suddenly shoot out his
long neck, thereby giving the old gentleman a bad
attack of the &#8220;nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>There remains one other piece of &#8220;stage furniture&#8221; to be constructed.
This is the gallows&mdash;which plays such an important part
in the exciting scene where Punch turns the tables on Jack Ketch.</p>

<p>Take a piece of wood six inches long, half an inch wide, and
an eighth of an inch thick, and nail it at right angles to the extremity
of another piece the same width and thickness, only eight inches
long. A third strip of wood must then be nailed diagonally between
the other two. The completed article will have the appearance of
<a href="#Fig46_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the longer arm must be whittled to a blunt point, and
a hole bored in Punch&#8217;s platform to receive it. Two small holes should<span class="pagenum" id="Page394">[394]</span>
also be bored in the short arm. They must be about two and a half
inches apart, and a piece of
string knotted in the first, then
looped down and threaded
through the second, as shown
in the diagram. It is into this
loop that the wily Punch persuades
Jack Ketch to place his
head, when the old fellow gleefully
gives a sharp pull to the
other end and hangs him.</p>

<p>To those readers who do

Toby presents a difficulty which
it seems impossible to overcome.
But all that is necessary
is to cut the head from a
wooden toy dog and attach it
to a stiff muslin gown, over
which some black paint has
been spotted to represent the
tight skin of a mongrel terrier.
By placing the hand up the
gown, this &#8220;Toby&#8221; can be
worked similarly to the puppets.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Many professional showmen use what is known as a &#8220;Punch
squeaker&#8221; for imitating Mr. Punch&#8217;s voice. Most
boys, with their well-known genius for mimicry,
will find it much easier to assume the high-pitched
tenor of Punch without any artificial aid. However,
for the benefit of those who are anxious to
cheer the neighbors with the dulcet notes of the
squeaker, instructions are given for making one.</p>

<p>First obtain a piece of tape six or seven
inches long and half an inch wide; also two
pieces of tin about two inches long and half
an inch wide. Both pieces of metal must then
be bent slightly in the center, and a single layer
of tape placed between them. The remaining
tape is next bound firmly round the outside,
all being held fast with thread. The finished
squeaker is illustrated in <a href="#Fig46_16">Fig. 16</a>. Before being
used it should be well soaked in water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page395">[395]</span></p>

<p>To produce the required sound place the squeaker between the
teeth, half speaking and half blowing the words through it.</p>

<p>The story of Punch is so well
known that most boys will be able to
work out a performance of their own.
But those who wish to give the correct
version of the adventures encountered
by our Hero of the Hump will find
at any theatrical publishers&#8217; a little book giving the complete
dialogue.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLVII</b><br />
DISSOLVING VIEWS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Without a Magic Lantern</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Previous</span> to the introduction of the cinematograph, dissolving views
ranked amongst the most popular of entertainments. By means of
a specially-constructed magic lantern, a painted picture from a glass
slide is thrown upon a screen. Then, at the will of the operator, the
picture apparently dissolves into a haze, through which a second picture
gradually makes its appearance.</p>

<p>Subjects are usually chosen which specially adapt themselves to such
an optical illusion. For instance, a picture might be shown of a small
country village, which slowly dissolves into a view of the same place
several years after,
when it has developed
into a thriving and
populous town.</p>

<p>But the specially
constructed magic lantern
necessary for these
dissolving views is a
very costly piece of
apparatus, the purchase
of which would entail
the careful saving of
two or three years&#8217;
pocket money. However keen a boy may be to provide some form
of home entertainment for the amusement of his friends, such an
alarming prospect would make his keenness dissolve as completely
as the pictures he hoped to display.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig47_1">

<img src="images/illo396.png" alt="" width="500" height="249" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Show as seen by audience.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter, however, to explain how an
apparatus may be constructed for a small sum that will bring about
effects similar to those of the special magic lantern costing many
dollars.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig47_1">Fig. 1</a> depicts the show as seen by the audience. It consists principally
of a framework not unlike that of a model stage, the dimensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page397">[397]</span>
of which must be left to the decision of the reader. For the sake
of convenience, however, it will be advisable to explain the method
of constructing apparatus capable of displaying views about the size
of a picture postcard.</p>

<p>A stage front similar to that in <a href="#Fig47_1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig47_2">2</a> should first be cut
from either thin wood or stout cardboard. The size of a picture postcard
is usually 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches by 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches.
Consequently the opening
in the stage front
must be about 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches
by 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches. This
allows for a nice margin
around each dissolving
view.</p>

<p>It will be noticed
from the diagrams that
both sides of the show
are fitted with two small
rods, bearing miniature curtains. These are to prevent the audience
seeing what the showman is doing &#8220;behind the scenes.&#8221; Their mode
of fixture is explained in <a href="#Fig47_3">Fig. 3</a>. Four pins, with their heads nipped
off, are bent in the shape of a horseshoe, and a pair driven into each
side of the stage front (A, <a href="#Fig47_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig47_2">

<img src="images/illo397a.png" alt="" width="400" height="216" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Show from back view.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The two rods, which can consist of thin pieces of cane, are then
pushed into the sockets
thus formed, and the curtains
threaded upon them
by means of a wide hem
sewn along the top. The
advantage of this method
of fixture is that when the
show is packed up, the curtains
can be easily removed
by merely pulling the rods
from their horseshoe-shaped
sockets.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig47_3">

<img src="images/illo397b.png" alt="" width="400" height="244" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Back view of partially constructed apparatus.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The floor or base of the
show must next be provided. Procure a piece of wood about 10
inches long, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch thick, and of the same width as the stage front.
A block of wood is then nailed or glued along one end of this, and the
stage front fixed firmly to it (<a href="#Fig47_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Having done this, make a journey to the nearest glazier&#8217;s, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page398">[398]</span>
purchase a piece of glass of about the same dimensions as the wooden
base. This should not cost more than ten cents. Clean the glass
thoroughly, and rest it against the top of the stage-front at an angle
of about 60&deg; (<a href="#Fig47_3">Fig. 3</a>). Next take a picture postcard, and lay it on
the wooden base between the end
of the glass and the stage front.
(See B, <a href="#Fig47_3">Fig. 3</a>.)</p>

<p>If the room now be darkened,
and a bright light thrown upon
the postcard, its reflection will be
clearly visible on the glass, and to
those looking through the stage
front it will appear exactly similar
to the view projected upon a
screen by a small magic lantern.</p>

<p>Should the reflection be at all
lopsided, the angle of the glass must be altered until this defect is
remedied. A block of wood, or an ordinary cigar-box, must then
be placed upon the wooden base with its edge along the glass, and
nailed securely in position. (See A, <a href="#Fig47_4">Fig. 4</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig47_4">

<img src="images/illo398a.png" alt="" width="400" height="261" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Showing position of picture postcard
and glass screen.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Three pieces of cardboard are the next requisites. One piece
is to be glued to the block of wood or cigar box at the back of the
show; the other along one side, and the last
over the top, as depicted in <a href="#Fig47_4">Fig. 4</a>. It is now
necessary to slide out the glass and paint the
whole of the interior dead black.</p>

<div class="figright w250" id="Fig47_5">

<img src="images/illo398b.png" alt="" width="250" height="405" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Lighting apparatus
with serrated shutter.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Exhibiting</span></h3>

<p>Whilst the paint is drying the young showman
can turn his attention to the lights. These
merely consist of two lamps&mdash;photographic dark-room
lamps are most suitable, or a wax candle
will serve quite well. Each lamp is provided
with a cardboard shutter serrated at the bottom,
as shown in <a href="#Fig47_5">Fig. 5</a>. It is this serration that imparts
the dissolving effects to the various views.</p>

<p>When the paint is dry the first exhibition
may be given.</p>

<p>The room in which the entertainment is to take place must be
darkened; the glass placed in position between the cigar-box and the
stage front, and the lamps lit. Two picture postcards must also be
obtained; the first being placed upright upon the cigar-box at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page399">[399]</span>
back of the show, and the other on the wooden base between the
glass and the stage front. A glance at <a href="#Fig47_4">Fig. 4</a> explains this.</p>

<p>The two lamps must now be so arranged that the light from one,
whilst brightly illuminating the first postcard, leaves the portion of
the show behind the glass in complete darkness; and the light from the
other falls solely upon the card on the cigar box.</p>

<p>If the shutter of the first lamp is now closed, and that of the
second opened, the audience will see only the postcard at the back,
set in a frame of dead black.</p>

<p>The exhibitor should then slowly press down the shutter of the
second lamp, and simultaneously raise that of the first. The serrations&mdash;in
one case gently cutting off the light, and in the other permitting
it to stream forth gradually&mdash;will have the effect of making one postcard
slowly dissolve from view, and give place to the reflection of
the other.</p>

<p>The back of the show being in complete darkness, the glass acts as
a perfect mirror, and whilst the audience are gazing at the reflection
of the first card, a fresh view may be substituted for that at the back,
without their being aware of the change.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this, the showman must uncover the second
lamp and push down the shutter of the first. The result will be that
the reflected view fades from sight, and the fresh picture postcard
is displayed.</p>

<p>It is then a simple matter to slip the card already used from its
position between the glass and stage front, and insert another in its
place.</p>

<p>In this manner a succession of views may be made to dissolve into
one another.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, there is no limit to the dimensions
of such a show&mdash;the showman being guided by the size of the pictures
he is able to obtain. Picture postcards are always procurable, and no
difficulty should be experienced in obtaining slightly larger views from
magazines, art catalogues, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of course, in the very large shows a much brighter light is required,
and four lamps must be used instead of two.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLVIII</b><br />
INDOOR FIREWORKS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Without the Use of Explosives</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A firework</span> display without the employment of brimstone and
saltpeter is somewhat unusual. But it is quite possible to give such
a display, and to do so without the heavy expense usually
attending Fourth of July
pyrotechnics.</p>

<p>It is first necessary to
make a frame or &#8220;stage,&#8221;
upon which to present the
firework display. In appearance
this frame greatly
resembles a three-winged
clothes-horse; in fact, one
of these humble home
&#8220;thoroughbreds&#8221; may,
after slight alteration, be
easily pressed into service.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig48_1">

<img src="images/illo400.png" alt="" width="500" height="333" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Showing frame and side wings.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The question of dimensions rests entirely with the exhibitor.
<a href="#Fig48_1">Fig. 1</a> shows a diagram of the frame. As will be seen, its front is
divided into two compartments, A and B. The lower compartment,
B, is occupied by a scene of some Exposition Building. This must
be made of cardboard, and can either be permanently nailed to
the frame, or so constructed as to slide in and out between two grooves.
The advantage of the latter mode of fixture is that when the owner
of the firework show tires of one scene he can readily substitute
another.</p>

<p>To represent the windows and glass domes of the Exposition Building,
small squares should be cut from the cardboard scene and tissue
paper pasted over them. When a light is placed behind, the effect will
be very pleasing, and will considerably enhance the reality of the firework
display.</p>

<p>After draping the two side wings (C and D, <a href="#Fig48_1">Fig. 1</a>) with red or
green cloth, the framework or &#8220;stage&#8221; may be set aside, and attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page401">[401]</span>
paid to the fireworks themselves. They are by no means of a character
calculated to send cold shivers down the backs of timid parents. <a href="#Fig48_2">Fig. 2</a>
shows a portion of one. It simply consists of a piece of cardboard,
slightly larger than the top frame (A, <a href="#Fig48_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>A design similar to that in the diagram must be lightly penciled
upon it. Then, with a rather coarse needle, prick out this design with
a series of small holes, through which the light can easily penetrate.
It is also necessary to make four larger holes at each corner of the
card, and to drive four wooden pegs or nails into the corresponding
corners of the frame. By means of these the cardboard design can be
quickly removed from or fixed to the &#8220;stage.&#8221; (See D, <a href="#Fig48_4">Fig. 4</a>.)</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>From another piece of cardboard cut out a wheel about 6 inches
in diameter, and of the shape shown in <a href="#Fig48_3">Fig. 3</a>. The numerous spaces
between the spokes should be filled with pieces of transparent tissue
paper of various colors.</p>

<p>A small stand upon which this wheel can revolve is the next requisite.
This simply consists of a flat wooden base, with two wooden
uprights glued firmly upon it. These uprights are connected at one
extremity by a short piece of wire&mdash;an ordinary pin will serve the
purpose excellently&mdash;forming an axle for the cardboard to revolve upon.
<a href="#Fig48_3">Fig. 3</a> makes this quite clear.</p>

<p>Now to test the effect of the first firework.</p>

<p>Fix the cardboard design in the upper portion of the frame, and
stand the whole upon a table. Then take a magic lantern
(B, <a href="#Fig48_4">Fig. 4</a>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page402">[402]</span>
or, failing this, a bull&#8217;s-eye lantern or cycle lamp, and focus its rays
upon the cardboard design. Next place the &#8220;wheel&#8221; (C, <a href="#Fig48_4">Fig. 4</a>) in
such a position that the beam of light shines through one of the tissue
paper films, and then continues its original course to the screen.</p>

<p>When everything is in position, the room in which the display
is to take place must be darkened. Having done this, grip the
edge of the &#8220;wheel&#8221; by the thumb and forefinger, and spin it sharply
round.</p>

<p>As it swiftly revolves various colored beams of light will be thrown

holes, will present the appearance of a fountain of brilliant, life-endowed
sparks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Firework Boxers</span></h3>

<p>But our firework show gives scope for far better effects even than
this. Some time ago great surprise was caused at an exhibition by
the production of a firework boxer. With a little care and ingenuity,
the same surprising result may be produced in the following
<span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>By means of a needle prick out two boxers in a defensive position
(C and D, <a href="#Fig48_5">Fig. 5</a>). The others must then be designed; only in
this case, one boxer is administering the <i>coup de grace</i> to his unfortunate
opponent.</p>

<p>Two grooved strips of wood are next glued to the top and bottom,
as shown at A, <a href="#Fig48_5">Fig. 5</a>, and two pieces of cardboard slid between them
(B, B). These two cards should then be connected by three pieces of
wire, as shown in the diagram, and have their corners rounded off in
order to insure free movement in the grooves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page403">[403]</span></p>

<p>By pulling the left wire one pair of figures is hidden and the other
revealed. Thus we have two firework boxers, who will fight a short
but decisive contest.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;The firework boxers.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>There is another type of &#8220;indoor firework&#8221; working on the same
principle as the above. A reference to <a href="#Fig48_6">Fig. 6</a> will put the exhibitor in
possession of all its details.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>At first only the central &#8220;Catherine wheel&#8221; is seen by the
audience. Then, on the wire to the left being pulled, and the cardboard
to which it is attached raised, a fountain of fire shoots into
the air and bursts into a number of stars. A similar occurrence takes
place on the right, and by pulling the central wire the &#8220;Catherine<span class="pagenum" id="Page404">[404]</span>
wheel&#8221; is made suddenly to vanish and give place to the spectacle
depicted at D.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when manipulating these &#8220;mechanical&#8221; fireworks
that the hand does not come between the light and the framework.</p>

<p>Of course, on the above principles, numerous other designs may be
made for the show, and a stock of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; manufactured that will
dwarf any supply.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XLIX</b><br />
HOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">For Use at Home</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite easy to make a telephone, which besides affording amusement,
will, at times, be found extremely useful. Fitted from the ground
floor to the rooms above, or from your friend&#8217;s house to your
own, it is impossible to overestimate its convenience.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="Fig49_1A">

<img src="images/illo405a.png" alt="" width="200" height="548" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1<i>a</i>.&mdash;Section of case.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Of course it is quite possible to buy the parts
of a telephone ready made and fitted together,
but it is much more interesting to construct the
apparatus yourself.</p>

<p>The whole affair is so easily and cheaply
made that no difficulty can possibly be experienced,
and you have only to exercise care in
order to succeed in constructing a very handy
and interesting machine.</p>

<div class="figright w250" id="Fig49_1B">

<img src="images/illo405b.png" alt="" width="250" height="221" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1<i>b</i>.&mdash;Magnet case.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>For the apparatus to be of any practical use, a pair of receivers are
required&mdash;one for the person speaking, and the other for the person
listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page406">[406]</span></p>

<p>First of all purchase two bar-magnets, <i>i.e.</i> straight and magnetized
at one end only&mdash;not the ordinary horse-shoe magnets. These bar-magnets
should be about four inches long, and can be bought from
any electrician; at the same time obtain from him an ounce of silk-covered
wire, No. 36.</p>

<p>Before taking the magnets from the shop it would be as well to
test them. This can be done by placing the marked end of one to the
unmarked end of the other, and unless the former is able to support
the weight of the latter, do not take either, but insist upon the electrician
giving you stronger ones.</p>

<p>Having made your purchase, set to work upon the actual apparatus.
The first things to be made are the wooden cases for the magnets, and
these require care in construction.</p>

<p>From a straight broom-handle cut off two lengths, each a little
longer than the magnets, <i>i.e.</i> about 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long, and split them
carefully down the middle with a chisel. Along the center of each
of these halves cut a groove (B, <a href="#Fig49_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a>), in such a manner that when
the two halves are put together they fit properly, and there is room
for the magnet to slip backwards and forwards in the hole running
through them. Now glue the parts together and you will have two
short wooden tubes, or magnet cases, as shown in <a href="#Fig49_1B">Fig. 1<i>b</i></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making Mouthpieces</span></h3>

<p>Having made the cases for the magnets, now make the mouthpieces.
Procure two wooden boxes such as boot-buttons are sold in, and glue
one to the end of each of the wooden tubes you have just made, cutting
a hole in the bottom of the box to correspond with the bore of the
case. In <a href="#Fig49_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a> you will see the work, so far as you have completed it,
shown in section. In the lid of the box cut a clean hole the size of
a dime right in the center, but this lid must not be fastened to the
box just yet.</p>

<p>The next things to be made are two bobbins upon which to wind
the wire&mdash;one for each instrument. Cut a piece of fairly strong cardboard
about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch wide and just large enough in circumference to fit
the marked end of the magnets tightly. Divide your No. 36 wire into
two equal lengths, and wind each piece around the bobbins, leaving the
two ends free to the length of about two inches.</p>

<p>Next slip the magnet, M, into the groove, and push it through so
that the bobbin, L, is contained in the box C, <a href="#Fig49_2">Fig. 2</a>. Make two holes
in the bottom of this box, pass the ends of the wires through them
and fasten them with binding screws, as in the illustration
H, <a href="#Fig49_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page407">[407]</span></p>

<p>The thin plate which vibrates with the voice must next be made.
Obtain a smooth piece of very thin sheet-iron&mdash;of just such a texture
as is used by photographers for ferrotypes. Take the greatest care to
keep this perfectly flat. Cut two round pieces large enough to cover
the mouthpieces as you will see in P, <a href="#Fig49_3">Fig. 3</a>, where it is shown in
section. Take the lid in which you have already cut the circular hole
and fasten it to the box in such a way that it keeps the iron plate in
position (Q, <a href="#Fig49_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>Push the magnet very close to, but not quite touching, the disc of<span class="pagenum" id="Page408">[408]</span>
iron&mdash;say <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>th of an inch away, and fasten it in that position, either
by means of a wooden plug at the other end, or by driving a screw into
the case in such a way that it grips the magnet and holds it firm
(S, <a href="#Fig49_3">Fig. 3</a>). Fill up the hole at the other end of the case with a piece
of cork, glue or screw on the lid, keeping the opening so that it almost
touches the iron disc, and your telephone is complete. <a href="#Fig49_3">Fig. 3</a> shows
in section how it should now
appear.</p>

<p>It remains only to make
the connections with the batteries
in the manner shown in
<a href="#Fig49_4">Fig. 4</a>, and you will be able
to speak with your telephone.
It is very possible, however,
that the voice will carry faintly,
but do not be disappointed, as
this can be very easily remedied
by making an apparatus which
is usually attached to the telephone,
and is known as</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>This instrument, as its
name implies, serves to make
small sounds greater. Besides
being useful in conjunction
with a telephone, it is also of
interest in itself.</p>

<p>Make a base, BC, and an
upright, A, from a piece of
thin pine wood, as shown in
<a href="#Fig49_5">Fig. 5</a>. Buy from the electrician
two blocks of carbon
such as are used in batteries
(these will cost but a few cents), each measuring about a cubic inch.
In one side of each of these blocks fasten a long binding screw, whilst
in an adjacent side make a hollow with a rat-tailed file or a penknife.
Then get a small pencil of charcoal such as is used in the large arc
lamp, and cut off a piece 4 inches long; file both ends to a point in
the way that you sharpen a pencil (E, <a href="#Fig49_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>Having made these various parts, fit them together. Screw the
two pieces of carbon to the upright in such a way that one rests<span class="pagenum" id="Page409">[409]</span>
upon the base whilst the other is at such a height that the charcoal
pencil rests lightly in the hollows, between the two carbons, as in
DD, <a href="#Fig49_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>The microphone is now
complete, and can be attached
to the telephone as shown in
<a href="#Fig49_6">Fig. 6</a>. It will be found to
increase the sound to such an
extent that your voice will be
distinctly audible, and conversation
perfectly clear.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Connection of microphone and telephone.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>By attaching one receiver
and the battery to the microphone
as shown in <a href="#Fig49_7">Fig. 7</a>, very
slight sounds will be increased
to an extraordinary degree.
The ticking of a watch seems like so many heavy footfalls, and if you
can succeed in getting a fly to walk across the sounding-board, as
the base is called, the footsteps will be plainly heard. Many interesting
experiments can be performed in this manner, and as the microphone
is so easily made, it is well worth constructing one for the sake
of such experiments alone.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER L</b><br />
TELEGRAPHY AT HOME</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Galvanometer Adapted</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> most of the inventions that have revolutionized the world, the
electric telegraph is constructed upon the simplest principles.</p>

<p>As will be shown, an instrument for transmitting and receiving
messages can easily be made at a very small cost by any one prepared
to devote a little care to its construction; and when completed it will
be found of considerable use and convenience.</p>

<p>To make a model of the elaborate machines now employed, which
not only receive but print messages in legible Roman characters,
would be far beyond the scope of any amateur, necessitating the
purchase of many costly parts and requiring a considerable knowledge
of engineering to fit them satisfactorily together. But the
instrument that can be made according to the following instructions,
is exactly similar to those in use throughout many smaller offices the
world over.</p>

<p>The telegraph is based upon the following principle. A current of
electricity, passed through a hoop of wire within which a needle is
suspended, will move that needle from left to right, or from right to
left, according as the wires are attached to one or other of the poles
of a battery. This simple apparatus is called a galvanometer. A telegraph
instrument is nothing but a galvanometer adapted to convenient
usage.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the method of construction, it would be as
well to inform whoever undertakes this work that the utmost care is
necessary in adjusting the various parts. The slightest fault will certainly
spoil the whole instrument, and the least carelessness render all
the labor expended utterly useless.</p>

<p>Now to describe the simplest way to make a receiver and transmitter.</p>

<p>Three pieces of wood will be required, a cigar-box furnishing the
best material for the purpose; if you have not one at home, any tobacconist
will let you have one for a few cents.</p>

<p>To commence with the base. Cut a piece of wood measuring 6<span class="pagenum" id="Page411">[411]</span>
inches by 5 inches. In this two grooves must be made (D D and E)
according to the measurements shown in A, <a href="#Fig50_1">Fig. 1</a>. The width of
these grooves must, of course, depend upon the thickness of the wood,
for the dial and the upright will have to be fitted into them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig50_1">

</div><!--split5050-->

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>For the dial you will require a piece of wood similar to the base,
but measuring 5 inches by 4 inches. One end of this should be
rounded as shown in B, <a href="#Fig50_1">Fig. 1</a>. Drill a hole (F) right through this
dial, 3 inches from the bottom and 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches from either side. As a
piece of wire will have to revolve easily in this hole, take great care
to cut it cleanly. In the lower end of the dial cut out two notches
(G H), each according to the measurements in B, <a href="#Fig50_1">Fig. 1</a>, <i>i.e.</i> <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch
deep and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch wide. Each notch must be <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch from its side of
the dial.</p>

<p>The upright is very easily made, being simply a strip of wood 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches by 1 inch (C, <a href="#Fig50_1">Fig. 1</a>). In this drill a hole (K) 3 inches from
the end and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch from either side, taking the same care as with the
hole in the dial.</p>

<p>Having thus prepared the several pieces of the framework, the dial
should be glued into its groove. A small square block of wood glued
into the angle formed by the base and the dial will insure the latter&#8217;s
being perfectly perpendicular. The upright will be fixed in its place
later.</p>

<p>To proceed with the more delicate part of the work. Cut a piece
of cardboard, fairly thin in texture, 5 inches long and 1 inch wide, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page412">[412]</span>
bend it into the shape of an oblong hoop. Upon the hoop or bobbin
wind about half an ounce of fine cotton-covered copper wire, size No.
36, which can be obtained from any electrician. Wind this wire very
carefully and evenly, but not tightly, leaving about 4 inches free at
either end (A, <a href="#Fig50_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The next thing to be made is a magnetized needle, which can be
easily done as follows. Take a piece of ordinary watch spring, an
inch long, and make it red hot. When in this condition drill a hole
through the center, and when it is cooler round the ends, as in B, <a href="#Fig50_2">Fig. 2</a>.
Heat it once more to a red heat and then plunge into cold water to
harden. The needle must now be magnetized by being drawn several
times firmly across the pole of a strong magnet, care being taken that
it is always drawn in the same direction.</p>

<p>The pointer (C, <a href="#Fig50_2">Fig. 2</a>) should be made in a similar manner, except
that it must not be magnetized, and should be at least twice as large as
the needle. Through the hole in the magnetized needle pass a couple
of inches of straight stout wire, and with a little solder, or even sealing-wax,
fasten the needle as shown in B, <a href="#Fig50_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>All these parts can now be fixed together. In the middle of the
broad side of the coil of wire you must push aside the strands in such
a manner that holes can be made through the cardboard hoop. Pass
the two ends of the thick wire, to which the needle is attached through
these holes, so that the needle is then suspended within the coil. Take
care to make these holes large enough to allow the axles of the needle
to revolve freely, as the whole success of your apparatus depends upon
the needle turning easily within the coil, which should now appear as
in <a href="#Fig50_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Fasten the coil upon the back of the dial, one end of the protruding
axle passing through the hole you have already made in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page413">[413]</span>
wood. Then glue the upright firmly in its groove, with the other
end of the axle through its corresponding hole. Take great care that
the needle can revolve freely
within the coil. Fasten the
pointer to the end of the axle
passing through the dial, and
in this latter drive two pins or
wooden pegs (P P) on either
side of the pointer, in order
that it may only move within
a limited arc (B, <a href="#Fig50_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Testing</span></h3>

<p>It would now be as well
to test what you have already
done. Connect the loose ends
of the coil to the poles of a
battery, reverse them, and repeat this two or three times. If the
instrument has been properly made, the needle should swing to the
left when the wires are connected in one way; to the right when they
are reversed.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Nothing more remains to be done but to make the keyboard, which
is really the base of the instrument you have just been constructing.
A glance at <a href="#Fig50_4">Fig. 4</a> shows how this is to be done. C and D are two
thin brass springs, 5 inches long, and, as they have to pass through
the notches in the dial, less than half an inch in width, they must
be bent upwards, so that when fastened to the board at C and D<span class="pagenum" id="Page414">[414]</span>
the opposite ends will spring up and press against the under side
of the metal bridge BF. They are then in what is called &#8220;metallic
contact.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bridge should be made from a piece similar to the springs
and bent as shown in <a href="#Fig50_5">Fig. 5</a>. Another strip of brass must be screwed
flat to the board at AE, parallel to BF, and over this a couple of
wooden or ivory knobs should be fastened to the springs, as they are
used to press down CD in contact with AE (<a href="#Fig50_4">Fig. 4</a>). When released
they should fly back to BF. Be very careful to see that all these details
are thoroughly in order, as they form the most vital part of the
keyboard.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Message Transmitting</span></h3>

<p>At the ends CD of the springs fasten two binding screws, and do
the same at A and B. Fasten the two loose ends from the coil to C
and D, and attach the wires from the battery to A and B. Now is the
time to see whether your machine has been properly made. By pressing
down one key you will find that the current of electricity deflects the
needle and the pointer to one side, and by releasing this key and pressing
the other one, the pointer will swing down to the other side. If this is
done satisfactorily your telegraph instrument is complete, and with a
couple of them you will be able to send messages from one room, or one
house, to another.</p>

<p>The complete apparatus should appear as in <a href="#Fig50_5">Fig. 5</a>, which also shows
the connections with the battery.</p>

<p>A couple of Daniels&#8217; cells, or two ordinary dry batteries are sufficient
to work both instruments.</p>

<p>Two copies of the Morse alphabet should also be made, one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page415">[415]</span>
be kept by the side of each machine. When the needle deflects
to the left it designates a dot. When it turns to the right it is
a dash. A short space separates the letters, and a longer one the
words.</p>

<p>When the alphabet has been mastered both for transmitting and
receiving, the use of your telegraph will be a matter of the greatest
simplicity, and you will be able to send messages with considerable
speed to your friend at the other end of the line. Below, the Morse
alphabet is given, as well as a message, which it is hoped you will be
able to send.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LI</b><br />
ELEMENTARY HYPNOTISM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Mysteries and Marvels of &#8220;Under-Sleep&#8221;</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term &#8220;Hypnotism&#8221; is defined in Nuttall as &#8220;an artificially induced
state of sleep,&#8221; and is of Greek origin, the prefix &#8220;hypo&#8221;
signifying &#8220;under&#8221; or &#8220;beneath,&#8221; and the Greek root &#8220;hypnos,&#8221;
sleep.</p>

<p>Hypnotic, or &#8220;under-sleep&#8221; conditions, may be induced in several
ways, and are not limited to the best-known method, that of absorbing
the attention of the subject by means of an object; for oblivion may be
caused quite as successfully by means of the sense of touch as in gentle
continuous stroking, pressure of the skin, by the motion of the hands
over the body without touch, or by soothing words, which, accompanied
by the penetrating magnetism of the eye, convey hints or suggestions to
the intelligence.</p>

<p>Methods of hypnotism may be divided into two <span class="nowrap">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Mental Method</i>&mdash;which directs the subject&#8217;s imagination and
senses to co-operation, creates an image in his mind, thrusts the
dormant brain into a totally different environment from that to which it
is accustomed, renders it extraordinarily hypersensitive to suggestion,
and unfolds experiences probably hitherto unique, at the will of the
exponent.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Physiological Method</i>&mdash;that steeps the faculties in oblivion as
completely as when chloroform is administered.</p>

<p>This latter form is often used as a therapeutic means of securing
rest and relief from pain. It has been proved that individual
character takes a far greater part in the mental method than the
physiological.</p>

<p>When an object is used to induce hypnosis, it is held at a distance of
about eight inches from the eyes, and removed gradually to a foot above
the forehead (<a href="#Fig51_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>During this process the gaze should follow the slowly moving
object until the lids are strained to their widest extent (<a href="#Fig51_1A">Fig. 1<i>a</i></a>).
This position naturally fatigues the eyeballs and causes the lids to close
swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page417">[417]</span></p>

</div><!--right6040-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split6040-->

<p>It is not essential that a glittering object be used. It has been
found that the finger of the operator, moved gradually, is as successful
a means as any object. Should the hypnotizer desire to enforce
slumber, he may accompany
his action with suggestions
that the subject
is extremely tired and
longing for sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are worn-out.
Your head is heavy. Your
limbs are fatigued. You
need rest. Sleep is essential.
You are gradually
falling asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before hypnotism can
take place, the patient
makes his mind a perfect
blank, and concentrates
his whole being and vision
on the button, coin, glass,
or crystal held before him.
It will now be seen that
his eyes begin to water, the pupils undergoing a series of changes,
contracting, dilating, and recontracting, as if he were succumbing
to natural slumber. His sight becomes gradually insensible to the
light, and in a few moments he is unconscious.</p>

<p>The state of hypnotism begins with the
second narrowing of the pupil, and is accompanied
by a quickening or retarding of the
pulse, rigidity of body and heaviness of brain,
which becomes chaotic and wildly confused
before the final stage is reached. The will is
entirely surrendered to the hypnotizer, and the
subject is powerless to move, speak, or feel,
except at his suggestion.</p>

<p>A sure test that the individual experimented
upon is really oblivious to everything about
him is shown when the operator gently moves
his arms from his side in a horizontal position
and lifts his eyelid. When the arms remain rigidly outstretched and
the eyeball is fixed and glassy, the exponent is assured that his subject
is completely at his mercy (<a href="#Fig51_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page418">[418]</span></p>

<p>In order to bring about this condition successfully, the hypnotizer
must possess no small amount of cultured will-power and concentration.
His mind must be absorbed in the experiment as wholly as the
subject&#8217;s faculties are concentrated upon him. He is now forcing his
brain to act at his dictation,
not only upon his own movements,
but upon those of the
individual chained to him by
his exertion of hypnotic influence.
One mind operates
them both, and, during his
subject&#8217;s trance, he has as
complete a sway over his
nervous system as if he possessed
two bodies and a double
supply of arms and legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig51_2">

<img src="images/illo418.png" alt="" width="450" height="319" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;The subject, when hypnosis is complete.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The eyes, whether closed
or widely open, are focused
on his brain, insensate of everything beyond the compelling force creating
his thoughts. He can hear sounds, smell, taste, see, talk, or remain
silent&mdash;only in obedience to that petrifying will.</p>

<p>Of every movement of our bodies, the brain is supreme operator.
The code of suggestion is flashed through telegraph wires composed
of nerves and muscles. No turn of the head, twitch of the finger, beat
of the heart, can take place without the coalition of those wonderful
brain-cells. When an individual is stricken with paralysis, and has lost
all power over his limbs, it is not because his bodily organs are injured.
Impotence is caused by the fact that his brain has lost its ability to
exert its power over his organs.</p>

<p>The wheels of a brain, however carefully oiled and cleaned, remain
motionless unless the engine fires are lit; and, in hypnotism, helplessness
is not brought about by the mastery of the exponent over every
separate joint and muscle (for it would be absolutely useless, even
were it possible, for him to concentrate his attention on every minute
movement of the body), but simply because he is robbing the brain of
its individual control, and is exerting his own will to dominate the purpose
and identity of his subject as relentlessly as the magnet dominates
the needle.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Weak-willed Subjects not Essential</span></h3>

<p>Some subjects are less amenable to hypnotic influence than others.
The belief that those of weak will are the easiest prey is a fallacy.</p>

<p>The real reason lies in the fact that the individual is incapable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page419">[419]</span>
concentrating his will in obedience to the dominating mind. This is
generally the case with persons inclined to hysteria or of neurotic temperament,
and for such, a revolving glass is the best object to be gazed
upon, as it wearies the eye and induces slumber without the need of
concentration or surrender of will.</p>

<p>There are others who cannot easily be hypnotized because they determinedly
set themselves to oppose the purpose of the operator to
such an extent that his brain
becomes exhausted in the process
and loses its potency. In
such cases the best plan is for
the hypnotizer to inspire faith
by means of experiments performed
over other individuals
in the presence of the resisting
or cynical, until the incredulous
are convinced that the hypnotic
influence is not induced by
trickery or confederacy. The
influence of imitation is an important
factor in hypnotism, and
faith once founded does a great
deal to overcome defiant wills.</p>

<p>It has been found that some
of the best results have been
those when the subject is taken
completely by surprise.</p>

<p>The <i>motion of the hands</i>
often brings about unconsciousness
as swiftly as when an object
is used. The hypnotizer
should stand a few paces from
the subject, gaze into his eyes,
and with hands raised sweep them gently in continual passes over the
body, reaching from above the head to below the hips. This action should
be continued without a pause for some minutes, the hands sweeping
across the face, as near as possible without touching it (<a href="#Fig51_3">Fig. 3</a>). The
motion may also be performed at the back of the subject (<a href="#Fig51_3A">Fig. 3<i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The body will gradually sway backwards or forwards, the gaze
become fixed and lifeless until the subject&#8217;s will is surrendered, when,
by withdrawing a few paces and raising a finger, the exponent will be
able to draw him in any direction he wishes.</p>

<p>The power of hand motion has been explained as due to stimulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page420">[420]</span>
over those zones of the body most susceptible to hypnotic influence,
or the slight motion of the air, or mental influence. It is
probable that all these influences combine, the most important being the
mental influence.</p>

<p>The idea that the hypnotizer possesses some magnetic fluid which
passes from him to the subject in the process of hypnotism has been
proved to be without any foundation, and is merely a foolish superstition.
There is nothing
mysterious or supernatural
in the influence of this
power. It is due entirely
to the exertion of mental
force and the involuntary
co-operation of the individual
hypnotized.</p>

<p>Performance of hypnotism
in a drawing-room is
not difficult, although, like
everything else, it needs
practice and perseverance
before it can be successfully
accomplished; and,
unless the mind of the
hypnotizer is disciplined to
determination and control,
it naturally fails to act upon
other minds.</p>

<p>Now, provided that the
student has some knowledge
of the subject, and has
trained himself to keep his
attention fixed, to the exclusion
of everything else,
upon the matter in hand, a few experiments may be undertaken. Elementary
ones should be essayed at first.</p>

<p>Fix upon an individual among your onlookers. Ask him to withdraw
for a moment or two, while you and your friends decide what
he shall accomplish. However simple the action, every mind must be
concentrated upon it, and there must be no laughing or talking.</p>

<p>If you know something of the character and temperament of the
subject chosen, this will aid you considerably. He should have faith
in your power, and willingly surrender his will to your control. As
an aid to concentration, request him to close his eyes; or, better still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page421">[421]</span>
blindfold them. Next turn him round several times, taking care not
to induce giddiness. Your only reason for doing this is to shut out
all objects that may draw his thoughts from your purpose.</p>

<p>Place the tips of your fingers lightly on his shoulders, but do not
push him forward (<a href="#Fig51_4">Fig. 4</a>). He must move only when he feels the
impulse of your will impelling him with sufficient force to render
resistance difficult or impossible. He will probably stand motionless
for a few moments, and this is
when spectators are inclined to
giggle a little, just as when, for
no particular reason, one&#8217;s risibilities
are stirred while being
posed before a camera.</p>

<p>If, however, the slightest
sound intrudes upon the silence,
the growing spell will be broken,
for it at once disturbs the train
of thought surrounding the subject,
and draws his attention from
your will. Silence is absolutely
essential, for it has almost as
powerful an influence as the
strongest will.</p>

<p>This gained, you will feel
your subject sway a little under
your fingers before he goes
slowly and unhesitatingly forward,
feeling his way with outstretched
hands, and walking
with the peculiar tread of a
somnambulist, until he unerringly picks up the photograph, takes a
pin from the curtain, removes a flower from a vase and places it in
his button-hole, or any other trivial act you have fixed upon. Then
he will pause, as if in relief that the deed is accomplished.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Inducing hypnotic sleep.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Only one action should be decided upon at a time&mdash;the simpler the
better to begin with.</p>

<p>As you excel in this form of hypnotism, you may try more complicated
experiments, but not until you have overcome the rudimentary
difficulties and have developed your powers to such an extent that you
have absolute faith in your ability, for self-reliance and self-confidence
are the corner-stones of hypnotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page422">[422]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Auto-Suggestion or Self-Hypnosis</span></h3>

<p>In order to cultivate these, experiment upon yourself by the means
of auto-suggestion or self-hypnosis, which is a splendid means of training
those faculties necessary to the mastery of other minds.</p>

<p>Change your state by means of words which imply a condition either
mental or physical not personally experienced by you, and believe implicitly
in your own ideas. Treat yourself exactly as if you were
experimenting on another individual, surrendering your subjective and
objective mind wholly to absorb the idea conveyed, and gradually its
meaning will influence and take possession of your brain to the exclusion
of everything else.</p>

<p>The change suggested should be exactly opposite to your natural
state&mdash;for instance, if you are warm, tell yourself determinedly that
you are cold until you credit the fact, when your body, which blindly
follows mind and will, experiences the sensation of cold.</p>

<p>If you have a headache, suggest that the pain has gone, &amp;c. Auto-suggestion
may be perfected to such an extent, that, under its hypnotic
trance, a needle may be plunged into the skin without the action&#8217;s causing
the slightest degree of pain.</p>

<p>In suggestion, it is always the subjective mind that is swayed by
hypnotic influence. This is always keenly alive, and it is through its
medium that the subject is induced to an extraordinary power of imagining
and experiencing the processes suggested by the hypnotizer.</p>

<p>Elementary exhibitions are very entertaining, and are quite sufficient
to illustrate the motive power which achieves your purpose. Some individuals
are better hypnotists than others, because they have a natural
supply of animal magnetism at their disposal, but it is extraordinary
what results can be brought about by study and patience, so that students
less gifted need not despair of success.</p>

<p>For the sake of those who have succeeded in such simple experiments
as the foregoing, the following may be undertaken. In these, intuition,
sympathy, and imagination play almost as important a part as thoughtful
concentration, which is ever the most powerful possession in the
outfit of the hypnotizer.</p>

<p>Here, one word as to the difference between the terms <i>hypnotist</i> and
<i>hypnotizer</i>. The former is a scientist, who employs his art solely for
therapeutic or medicinal purposes. The latter is the entertainer, and
care should be taken to distinguish between the two words.</p>

<p><i>Experiment.</i>&mdash;Place the subject in a chair, with palms on knees.
Pass your hands over him for a space of several minutes, the while
his eyes are fastened on your own. Watch his expression carefully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page423">[423]</span>
It undergoes several changes, the individual character dominating
(<a href="#Fig51_5">Fig. 5</a>), gradually disappears, and finally gives place to vacancy
(<a href="#Fig51_5A">Fig. 5<i>a</i></a>). The firm lines of the mouth fade, and the lips become
slightly parted. The face grows blank and purposeless, the eyes staring
and void.</p>

<p>You have some plan in your mind which you are straining to
impress on his brain. Supposing it is that he shall not remove his
hands from his knees. Say to him, in a low soothing voice, which
penetrates his hearing perfectly (to shout, breaks the spell in a moment),
&#8220;Your hands are stuck to your knees; you cannot remove them. They&#8217;re
glued; they&#8217;re tight fast. Do what you will, you can&#8217;t lift them. Now
try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At your dictation he endeavors to do so. He lifts his knees. He
ducks his head, trying to push his hands away by means of his chin,
but every effort is futile until you say, &#8220;You can now remove your
hands. See, it is quite easy, they are free!&#8221; At once he lifts them
easily.</p>

<p>Now ask him his name. He tells you in a dazed, obedient voice
that it is &#8220;John Jones.&#8221; You determine he shall forget his name.
You say to him again and again, &#8220;You have forgotten your name.
You cannot tell me what it is. You don&#8217;t know your own name; you
can&#8217;t remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subject&#8217;s face at once indicates that he is absolutely nonplused.
He struggles to remember, but in vain. Should you suggest that his
name is Mary Smith, he will believe you implicitly, and, with a relieved
expression, declare this name to be his own.</p>

<p>Bid him open his mouth as wide as he can. Then say to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page424">[424]</span>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t shut your mouth. It is fixed, rigid. Try to shut it.&#8221; He
vainly endeavors to do so. He places one hand on his head, the other
on his lower jaw, and tries to force his lips together, but he is powerless
so long as your will opposes him. When you command him to shut
his mouth, he does so without effort.</p>

<p>A subject should not be kept longer than a few moments in this
subservience to your will. He can be released by a snap of your fingers
at his ears or before his eyes. Address him softly by his name, and
he will return to consciousness in an instant. When he looks dazedly
round, reassure him, kindly, that he is quite well, and will suffer no
harmful results from your experiments.</p>

<p>The hypnotizer should never abuse his power over an individual.
He must possess sufficient humanity to prevent him from keeping his
subject too long under control.</p>

<p>When he finds a subject who answers readily and quickly to the
hypnotic influence, he may be tempted to continue an exhibition of his
powers in order not to lose time on less amenable individuals, but he
should determinedly resist this temptation.</p>

<p>A valuable aid for him will be to time his experiments by a watch,
limiting each individual&#8217;s trance to a space of, at most, four minutes&#8217;
duration.</p>

<p>The hypnotizer must be in perfect health, for, unless his body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page425">[425]</span>
nerves, and mind are in proper condition, the supply of animal magnetism
fails. He must study hygiene, take sufficient exercise, and be
most particular to keep his body, linen, hair, and finger-nails scrupulously
clean.</p>

<p>A dirty finger, held up before a subject undergoing the hypnotic
trance, inspires the latter with a revolting sense of disgust, and clouds
the vision conjured by the brain.</p>

<p>The hypnotic entertainer should abstain from any indulgences, and
eat only plain, wholesome food. During the process of hypnotism, the
exponent should never lose his head or self-reliance. Any dread experienced
by him is at once conveyed to the subject. Should the latter be
unable to awake from the trance at command, the operator must wave
his handkerchief before his eyes. If these are closed and refuse to
open, he must at once rub the eyebrows with the tips of his fingers,
beginning at the root of the nose, and ending at the temples, terminating
this action by gentle fanning or blowing until such efforts meet with
success (<a href="#Fig51_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>It should always be remembered by the student that the power of
hypnotism&mdash;like fire&mdash;is a good servant, but a bad, tyrannical, and lawless
master, unless properly controlled.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LII</b><br />
THE POWERS AND MYSTERIES OF CLAIRVOYANCE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marvels of the &#8220;Sixth&#8221; Sense</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Clairvoyance</span>, originally a French word, means the ability to see clearly.
The reason so few people possess this extraordinary psychic faculty, is
because most human beings are three-quarter parts blind, deaf, and
insensate to anything beyond the ordinary emotions.</p>

<p>The power of prophecy and acute intuition is a sixth sense which
most of us have in a slight degree dormant and uncultivated.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance has often been mistaken for superstition or wilfully
imposed and cunning deceptions, and it is difficult for ignorant and
cynical people to believe that it is founded on science and truth.</p>

<p>It has stood firm through the ages in spite of the quackery of
wizards, paraphernalia of sorcerers (used to inspire fear and awe in
the uninitiated), the sneers of those of material minds. All of us at
some time or other have felt the control of that still small voice, potent
and penetrating as conscience, which comes, unaccompanied by earthquake
or fire, to instill us with awe, joy, extreme sadness, or
warning at some critical juncture of our lives; often anticipating, with
power greater than speech can convey, some event that concerns our well-being.</p>

<p>Why this power should be deemed more extraordinary or mysterious
than the senses of sight, hearing, smell, and touch which, even to those
thoroughly conversant with the anatomy of the human body, remain
steeped in mystery, it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Science teaches that a million delicate sounds escape the ear and
brain, and as many minute exquisitely fashioned atoms escape the eye.</p>

<p>A magnifying glass reveals the marvelous structure of insects and
microbes invisible to naked sight, and it is only by means of a telescope
that the beauty of the stars is discerned; thus the developed power of
clairvoyance may be called the magnifying lens of the soul.</p>

<p>It is because this lens is dull and misty that we fail to see.</p>

<p>The history of ages and a great deal of our most cherished literature
prove its existence.</p>

<p>Many of the stories and prophecies of the Bible are founded on<span class="pagenum" id="Page427">[427]</span>
clairvoyance. People were simpler and more trusting then; for this
reason visions and clear sight were granted them.</p>

<p>Pilate&#8217;s disregard of the warning conveyed in his wife&#8217;s dream, affected
the whole course of Christianity, and the Bible abounds with
examples of the disasters that befell those who disobeyed the spiritual
promptings sent them.</p>

<p>This wonderful faculty of inner sight is the possession of the individual
born blind. He demonstrates its existence when by merely
passing his fingers over an object he can describe exactly a color he has
never seen. In him it is nature&#8217;s recompense, and no one who watches
his movements can doubt that he is guided by this psychic organism,
yet when we note the same power granted to a man or woman blessed
with eyesight, we at once decide that happy coincidence, trickery, or
charlatanism is the origin of the manifestation.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance teaches that everybody has a distinctive color, which
conveys more of character and personality than any word or action.
The shades of these colors vary according to temperament, and are as
much concealed from untrained vision as the million tints composing the
gold, purple, and green bands of the rainbow.</p>

<ul class="clairv">

<li>Optimistic persons emanate a pale blue aura.</li>

<li>Large-minded progressive persons, a pale green.</li>

<li>Pessimistic worried persons, gray.</li>

<li>Ill-health in mind or body, dark green.</li>

<li>Kindly benevolent, humane persons, pink.</li>

<li>The thinker and scholar, deep blue.</li>

<li>The degraded, brown.</li>

<li>The passionate and bad-tempered, red.</li>

<li>The ambitious, orange.</li>

<li>The lover of the beautiful in Art, yellow.</li>

</ul>

<h3><span class="smcap">Keys to Character</span></h3>

<p>These colors, however, although providing the key to the character,
are subject to constant changes. Our moods sway and change our
thoughts according to the happenings that affect us.</p>

<p>For example, bereavement or anxiety has power to transform the
blue aura of the optimistic temperament to gray, and this temporary
change of color studied alone may perplex the clairvoyant, and mislead
him to a false diagnosis of character.</p>

<p>In order to prevent this, the seer will do well to request some article
constantly worn by the inquirer to be handed him; the older and
shabbier it is the better. A dilapidated glove, an everyday tie or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page428">[428]</span>
ring constantly worn are equally valuable by which to discriminate
between the temporary and habitual aura peculiar to temperament.
When a man&#8217;s glove emits a pale blue aura, in contradiction to the gray
of his own personality, the deduction is that he is naturally of a hopeful
and cheerful tendency, but that some mental anxiety or bereavement
causes the gray, deep or pale, according to the depth of emotion dominating
him.</p>

<p>The reason of this difference of colors is that the glove is, as it were,
saturated with the essence of his normal disposition, while the color of
his character has been changed by circumstances or environment.</p>

<p>In the brain there exists a small and delicate organ known as the
pineal gland, and it is thought by some scientists that this is responsible
for, and sensitive to, the subtle vibrations of ether which are too minute
to stir the tympanum of the ear. Its cultivation produces the power
that beholds and distinguishes the difference in shades of mental color
in which the mind is absorbed.</p>

<p>People of erratic temperament possess an aura of many and constantly
changing colors, but those whose calm never varies maintain but
one.</p>

<p>Some few persons are aware of the tones of their aura, and are
therefore keenly sensitive to the influence of their surroundings.</p>

<p>They will be perfectly miserable if the paper on their walls, or the
material of their clothes, clashes in color with that of their character;
while they are at their best and happiest surrounded by the tints that
blend or contrast harmoniously.</p>

<p>The clairvoyant&#8217;s outfit consists of six <span class="nowrap">qualities:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="clairv">

<li>1. Power of magnetism.</li>

<li>2. Mental health and influence.</li>

<li>3. Physical health and cleanliness.</li>

<li>4. Temperance in food and drink.</li>

<li>5. The power of discerning the aura and interpreting its colors.</li>

<li>6. The liberty from all evil or slothful habits.</li>

</ul>

<p>In advanced clairvoyance the use of the crystal for vision is designated
by many seers as &#8220;clap-trap&#8221; and vulgar &#8220;playing to the gallery.&#8221;
It is found to be injurious to eyesight and brain centers to gaze at any
shining article for too long a period, yet in parlor clairvoyance there
is no doubt that it has great power of inducing concentration of sight
and thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page429">[429]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crystal Gazing</span></h3>

<p>By means of crystal scrying the gazer creates and becomes subject
to the influence of auto-hypnosis&mdash;that is, he is able to throw himself
into a trance which veils his own personality and links him to that of
his client.</p>

<p>The surface of the crystal gradually reflects images, and subconscious
impressions conveyed by and vital to the individual whose past,
present, and future are being revealed.</p>

<p>Sympathy and intuition merge the soothsayer&#8217;s aura with the temperamental
coloring of his client. His magnetic force creates further
powers, while his psychic discernment or sixth sense is the nucleus about
which these are bound.</p>

<p>No student of clairvoyance can be successful in discerning character
and personal emanations of color unless he is disciplined by simple rules
which should govern his life.</p>

<p>Excessive eating, drinking, intemperance in any form, self-indulgence,
bad habits, and drugs destroy this delicate sixth sense past
redemption.</p>

<p>Want of sincerity and integrity results in the rapid decline of its
power.</p>

<p>The body and mind must be pure and of perfect mental and physical
balance. No nervous fretting or pettiness of outlook should be permitted
to intrude.</p>

<p>In clairvoyance the brain is ruled by large and lofty aims, and it
must be kept as unspotted and clean as a white garment; so only is it
capable of performing its proper functions.</p>

<p>Likewise it is essential to remember the important, nay, vital dominion
it exerts over the body, which cannot rise to perfect beauty and health
unless its mental orbit is lofty and serene.</p>

<p>In consulting a clairvoyant the client should be serious, earnest, and
trustful that he will hear the truth. Frivolity, incredulity, or idle
curiosity forms as it were a thick crust between the mind of exponent
and inquirer, which prevents the penetrating of thoughts and vision,
strains the powers, and results in disappointment.</p>

<p>In the same spirit in which one visits a doctor or solicitor should
the clairvoyant be approached, and there must be no determined reserve
to conceal thoughts and character in the mind.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance in a drawing-room full of people is extremely difficult&mdash;indeed
impossible, unless the onlookers can be induced to keep perfect
silence during the operation.</p>

<p>It is always better to be closeted alone with the inquirer in a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page430">[430]</span>
room to which street noises do not penetrate, provided only with the
necessary furniture, kept clean and fresh, airy, and well lighted.</p>

<p>The crystal should never be touched by any one save the clairvoyant,
and must be kept free from spots and smudges. A black silk handkerchief
round its globe will be a help to divination by preventing the
reflection of lights.</p>

<p>There may be, especially to beginners, temptations to pose as the
possessor of supernatural powers&mdash;to make passes over the crystal, light
wax tapers, burn perfumes, and murmur incantations&mdash;but these methods,
although employed by the ancient prophets, are of no aid to the
modern sage. Indeed, they do harm by appealing to the senses and
superstitions, and, being a mere affectation, are unworthy of that sixth
sense and harmful to it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Simple Manifestations Best</span></h3>

<p>The simpler the manifestation, the more assured the clairvoyant may
be of arriving at the truth.</p>

<p>Self-confidence, an absolute belief in his gift, and faith in his methods
dominate him.</p>

<p>He does not endeavor to avoid exertion of his nervous forces by
discreetly &#8220;pumping&#8221; the inquirer as to ways and means, but takes a
delight in silent investigation.</p>

<p>The clairvoyant should come to his task fresh and buoyant, bubbling
with enthusiasm, and yet without frivolity or thoughtless mind.
At the slightest sense of fatigue he should desist from his efforts,
for it is extremely harmful to apply any force or strain to this abstract
power.</p>

<p>Physical fatigue and excitement must be avoided, for these
engender jangled nerves, sleeplessness, and finally inability to isolate
the mind from the orbit of our own concerns to the sphere of
others.</p>

<p>The processes that occur in crystal-gazing are thought transference
and telepathy. A communication of ideas is set up between the prophet
and client, and the mirror-like surface of the crystal is the medium by
means of which innate thoughts are reflected.</p>

<p>As far as possible, the clairvoyant submerges his own personality
in that of the inquirer, putting himself in his or her place. The best
means of creating these links is to place an article constantly worn by
the inquirer to the head. Profound silence brings about the sense of
atmosphere and aura usual to the latter, and by these means, and an
intent gazing into the crystal, visions originate.</p>

<p>The crystal is supposed to be the magic bridge which spans the<span class="pagenum" id="Page431">[431]</span>
chasm fixed between itself and the spiritual world. In the iron it
contains are situated the collective and culminating forces.</p>

<p>Mists of white, green, blue, and violet tints are symbols of good
fortune and happiness; black, yellow, and red are warnings of
disaster.</p>

<p>When the mists disperse and gradually ascend to the surface, the
clairvoyant may reply to any question in the affirmative; mists that
descend to the bottom are signs of negation.</p>

<p>Images that develop to the left of the clairvoyant are real; those
on the right are purely symbolical.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that in order to apply oneself to the
achievement of reading the secret depths of mind, character, talent, and
circumstances, it is necessary to possess the power of separating oneself
from material surroundings and allowing the spirit to dominate the
body.</p>

<p>This can only be executed by the process of hypnotizing oneself.
Clairvoyance is based on certain forms of this semi-somnolent state,
for, just as in hypnotism, the mind reigns supreme over matter and
becomes isolated by means of an object, so, in clairvoyance, a waking
trance is brought about by fixed gazing into the crystal.</p>

<p>However, there are other methods of inducing this state, more or
less difficult of manipulation, until constant practice and experience have
made them a habit.</p>

<p>For the reason, formerly mentioned, that long gazing at a bright
surface is injurious to eyesight, many clairvoyants prefer to create
visions without the use of a crystal.</p>

<p>Words repeated over and over again have a mysterious power of
isolating the sixth sense from the rest.</p>

<p>For example, the word AUM is extraordinarily symbolical. It
stands for three <span class="nowrap">influences&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="blankbefore75">A = the objective.<br />
U = the subjective.<br />
M = the Eternal.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="blankbefore75">These are the three kingdoms in the heart of man.</p>

<p><i>The objective</i>, being the natural surroundings of objects and events
which we all can feel and see.</p>

<p><i>The subjective</i>, being the realm of influences the degree of which is
felt according to the perception and training of our spiritual forces;
too often vague and illusive, because most of us ignore its existence.</p>

<p><i>The Eternal World</i>, being that state to which the subjective world,
in its highest state of development, leads. This word repeated, slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page432">[432]</span>
and steadily at first, and then at great speed, has a marvelous power
to create as it were a vacuum between the spirit and body of the
prophet.</p>

<p>His mind dwells on its meaning; the vibration of the different letters
acts on his mind, and he is carried by gentle stages to the very seat of
his spiritual being.</p>

<p>It is when he attains this full development that he is granted large,
clear, and deep perceptions of his client&#8217;s character, and is able to reveal
facts concerning him which in his normal state would be absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p>The sensation experienced is that of being plunged into space in
which the senses of sight, hearing, and touch are transmuted to the brain
and spirit.</p>

<p>The student will doubtless be discouraged at first at his inability to
produce this state, but he should remember that hard work and perseverance
are the attributes which all must give to be perfect in any learning,
art, or science.</p>

<p>One destined to become a great mathematician stumbles in childhood
with despair over the first addition sum, and the most distinguished
musician has to do battle with the rudiments of music.</p>

<p>Thus it is in clairvoyance. Seemingly insuperable difficulties surround
the novice who has never learnt to recognize the value and power
of the sixth sense. Patience, a tranquil, determined mind, and not a
little courage, are necessary in this branch of science. Time and growth
work wonders in the persistent mind, and it will be seen that the obstacles
gradually move aside, the curtain is lifted, and the strenuous seeker
reaches that mature vision which he has formerly imagined dimly, if
at all.</p>

<p>It is a good plan for the novice to ponder on his own name, and,
shut away from all distractions, repeat it again and again to himself.
He will gradually feel a sense of deepest mystery surrounding him,
for in that name is concentrated the riddle of existence. The blending
of spiritual and material kingdoms lies behind it, and the material slips
rapidly into obscurity.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Eternal Question</span></h3>

<p>The eternal question based on introspection faces him. &#8220;What
am I? Whither am I going? What is the meaning of this thoughtful
brain, this palpitating heart, these stirring pulses through which the
mysteries of the soul flash in a thousand directions?&#8221;</p>

<p>These and many other questions will move into being until the
eternal atmosphere of spirituality is reached, and the wings of the soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page433">[433]</span>
become unfurled and increase in strength and power to lift him to the
realms of his desire.</p>

<p>Only when the heart is pure and worthy will the vision be granted&mdash;the
dross of bitterness, envy, hatred, and malice, which generally hide
the precious jewel from the light, and render scintillating brilliance
impossible, all discarded.</p>

<p>Every one knows how difficult it is to control the mind, and keep
it from mean and uncharitable thoughts. It is more rebellious even than
the body, and influences it for good or evil.</p>

<p>Temptations small and great are created and emerge from the mind.
No one thieves with his fingers until the thought of theft is born. His
mental faculties plan the ways and means and cunningly devise protections
against the punishment in which the act when culminated
results, unless artful deceptions render discovery impossible. No
treason or wrong-doing was ever committed before the deed was hatched
in the brain.</p>

<p>The mental sphere may be a hotbed of falsehoods and treachery,
or it may be a world of purest truth and virtue.</p>

<p>Therefore, before all else, the clairvoyant must learn to discipline
and constrain his thoughts, and this is extremely difficult, and seems
at first almost impossible; yet, if the lamp is to burn brightly, it must
be kept clean, and daily fed with all thoughts that are benevolent, gentle,
and good.</p>

<p>A humble demeanor, a longing for purity and singleness of purpose
are needed to bring about these noble qualities, and here it is that proper
treatment of the body is invaluable.</p>

<p>Simple diet, early rising, daily exercise, constant isolation, and cultivation
of good habits create the orbit for the higher faculties. These
are the elementary rudiments of clairvoyance, and, unless they are
mastered, the clairvoyant, no matter how diligent and persevering he
may be in his studies and labor, is doomed to failure.</p>

<p>A quiet state of mind helps in all the storms and stress of life. It
is a harbor of quiet blue waters, in which the seafaring vessel may
shelter beneath peaceful starlit skies, securing power and refreshment
and shafts of clearest light by which other human ships may be led
towards his haven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page434">[434]</span></p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LIII</b><br />
TABLE-TURNING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fun for an Impromptu Party</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something sufficiently fascinating about table-turning to fix
the attention and interest of guests gathered for an evening&#8217;s recreation,
and as it needs no previous arranging, it is an excellent device at an
impromptu party.</p>

<p>The table must be round, light, and of wood. As many of the
company as can be squeezed in its circle may take part, but the excitement
will be shared by the onlookers. Each places both hands lightly
on the surface with the thumbs touching, and the little finger joined to
that of his neighbor. It is important that there should be no break in
the chain of hands, as this prevents the flow of the electric current,
which is alone responsible for the vibration and movement of the table.</p>

<p>The time of waiting for its first motion must be spent in silence,
and may last from five to twenty minutes. Any &#8220;wag&#8221; who takes it
into his head to jerk the table with his knees, or push it with his hands
during this period, should at once be called upon to forfeit his
place.</p>

<p>Those experienced in table-turning know perfectly well how
different the movement caused by such a proceeding is from the real
tilt the table gives when moved by the electric current, and will soon
discover the impostor, for no trick can bring about the same curious
vibration.</p>

<p>The table should be treated with the greatest respect, otherwise its
&#8220;spirit&#8221; becomes taciturn and silent, and, even after the tilting backwards
and forwards has gone on for some time, it has been known to
retire at the slightest sign of levity and incredulity. Not until the
manipulators are assured of its movement should any question be asked,
and, before this is done, they must agree upon some plan by which
they may comprehend the answers given.</p>

<p>Two taps or bows may stand for &#8220;Yes,&#8221; one for &#8220;No,&#8221; or <i>vice
versa</i>; but, when once decided upon, should remain fixed.</p>

<p>The question must not be asked until the preliminary vibrations have<span class="pagenum" id="Page435">[435]</span>
ceased; then one of the party&mdash;the medium, so-called because he or
she possesses more magnetic power than the rest, addresses the spirit,
and those anxious to hear anything affecting themselves must use him
or her as mouthpiece. The table is questioned in some such way as
<span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Medium</i>&mdash;&#8220;Are you going to be kind to us to-night, O Spirit?
Please answer two taps for &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and one for &#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this polite request the spirit doubtless replies in the affirmative.
When ages and dates are required, the medium counts the number of
taps, and gleans the result when the taps cease.</p>

<p>Names are discovered by carefully going through the alphabet.
Each tap stands for a letter, and, when the table pauses, the initial
and other letters of the name are provided, until the whole is spelt
out. Thus, supposing the medium inquires the name of his left-hand
neighbor, which it may be presumed is Alice, the spirit, having apparently
heard the question, gives one decided jerk, and then is perfectly
motionless. The medium says &#8220;A&mdash;next letter, please.&#8221; The table
obediently bobs twelve times; that is, until L is reached. The medium
continues, &#8220;Next letter, please,&#8221; and the table obligingly bobs nine
times. &#8220;I,&#8221; says the medium&mdash;&#8220;next letter, please.&#8221; Three bobs
give C. Five bobs give E. The table is then motionless, and another
question may be asked.</p>

<p>Queries should never be clamored at once by the impatient guests,
nor should one monopolize the spirit&#8217;s attention with his own affairs.
A good plan to follow is for each in turn to supply the medium with
an inquiry. The initials, Christian or surname, of the man or maid
one is destined to marry may be revealed by the spirit. Initial letters
are better, because when there are many eager to know their fate, the
full names take too long.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will be noticed that the spirit gives very decided answers,
jerking to one side so abruptly that the players are obliged to
push back their chairs and have some difficulty in keeping their hands
on its surface. At other times it seems undecided, and if the question
is an unwelcome one, the spirit will race through the alphabet again
and again at a great speed and without a moment&#8217;s pause. When this
is the case, another question should be asked.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Presence of an &#8220;Unbeliever&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>Should the spirit refuse to communicate at the end of twenty
minutes, the manipulators may be sure that an &#8220;unbeliever&#8221; is in their
midst, or that the whole assembly has too small magnetic power. When
this happens, other persons should try their skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page436">[436]</span></p>

<p>As mediums are not uncommon, there will probably be one among
them, and a brief waiting at the table will prove that this is the case.</p>

<p>A good experiment to spare further waste of time is for the circle
of attendants to decrease until only sufficient are left to maintain the
chain. In this way the medium is discovered. A good medium creates
movement in five minutes or less, and, with a tiny tea-table, it has often
been shown that, when once set in full motion, all may withdraw except
the medium under whose magnetic touch the table will continue to
gyrate for several minutes.</p>

<p>The spirit has many characteristics, and sometimes tires of the part
expected of it, and, yielding to a frivolous mood, will dance or jump
all over the floor, sometimes carrying its ministers out of the room to
the passage. At others it remains true to the r&ocirc;le of dignified sage,
philosopher, and seer; but its moods are complicated, and these depend
a great deal upon the amount of concentration and will that
dominate it.</p>

<p>Constant peals of laughter provoke it to giddiness or abrupt, curt
&#8220;answers,&#8221; while not infrequently, after several hours in which inquiries
have been constantly fired at it, it shows a most discourteous
inclination to remain stolidly non-committal and motionless. Then the
medium with gentle coaxings may restore its good temper and patience,
but only for a short period.</p>

<p>Perhaps the real reason for this reserve is to be found in the
players themselves, whose magnetic power becomes exhausted, and
fails to act as spontaneously as during the early hours of the evening.
At any rate, when the medium asks courteously, &#8220;Are you very weary,
O Spirit?&#8221; the table will frequently reply with two most emphatic
bobs.</p>

<p>Another means of discovering a medium and an &#8220;unbeliever&#8221; (the
latter term does not imply a cynic, but simply an individual with an insufficient
supply of magnetism) is to ask the spirit to spell out the
name of the person it loves best. In nine cases out of ten, it will spell
out the name of the medium, and it will be found that it is as quick to

far removed from its vicinity.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LIV</b><br />
PALMISTRY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> social functions, such as garden and evening parties, fairs, &amp;c.,
there are few people whose notice and attentions are so solicited as the
palmist&#8217;s. He speedily finds himself the central figure of a knot of
people of both sexes, all eager to thrust their hands under his discerning
eye, and compare their own estimation of their character&mdash;which, alas!
is often subject to a severe shock&mdash;with that revealed by the sage&#8217;s
comparison of lines, mounts, and stars engraved upon the palm.</p>

<p>The true palmist is no flatterer, nor is he over-hasty in judgment.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Names of the
&#8220;mounts&#8221; and their
signs.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Most hands index as many contradictions and complexities of disposition
as the human face, and the experienced reader of these hieroglyphics
finds that, to secure a just diagnosis of the subject&#8217;s character,
comparison of the many signs and minute calculations are necessary.
The art of addition, subtraction, and multiplication is the fundamental
principle of his profession.</p>

<p>Shape, quality, proportion, and texture are of paramount importance,
and these should be examined before the lines are studied. The
size of the fingers, and the manner in which they are set on the hand,
furnish the key to the character of the hand examined. Each finger
has its name and sign, and each has its distinguishing characteristics.
For just as every leaf and petal possesses some minute difference that
distinguishes it from its neighbor, so no hands in the world are exactly
alike in form and structure.</p>

<p>The name given to the first finger is Jupiter; to the second, Saturn;
to the third, Apollo; to the fourth, Mercury; and to the thumb, Pollux.
<a href="#Fig54_1">Fig. 1</a> shows some signs with their respective names.</p>

<p>The natural bend of the fingers is important, and the palmist should
be quick to notice its natural attitude before examining the interior of
the hand.</p>

<p>Some fingers are distinguished by their independent, prominent position
over the rest. When the tips are inclined to curl to the palm, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page438">[438]</span>
plodding, determined nature is indicated, one that does not easily relinquish
a set aim or purpose because of obstacles.</p>

<p>A wide space between Jupiter and Saturn shows unconventionality,
and originality of thought and outlook.</p>

<p>When the Jupiter finger is upright and straight,
and of normal length, a just, candid nature is revealed.
Should its position be in advance of the
other fingers, the love of dominion. Falling slightly
behind: dependency on others, a shirking of taking
the initiative and responsibilities. Short: ingratitude,
no enthusiasm. Pointed: tact, comprehension,
and sympathy. (<a href="#Fig54_2">Fig. 2</a>.) Square: integrity, unkindly
frank in expressing opinions.</p>

<p>The generous and broad phalanges of Saturn
show gravity, depth of character, and sense of proportion.
A short Saturn: imprudence, inclination to
act on impulse, somewhat foolhardy. Spatulate:
energy. Square: cool, clear-headed, thought before action, absence of
hasty judgments. (<a href="#Fig54_3">Fig. 3</a>.)</p>

<p>Apollo: well-developed, artistic tendencies. Forward: painting,
drawing, or sculpture. Pointed: the artistic ability is greater than the
practical. Spatulate: a sense of the beautiful in form and color, dramatic
powers. (<a href="#Fig54_4">Fig. 4</a>.)</p>

<p>Mercury, set lower than the other fingers, reveals the fact that
many adverse circumstances have been battled with. Pointed: tact, discrimination,
intuition. Square: love of scientific pursuits, good reasoning
powers.</p>

<p>Beneath each finger rest their respective mounts. There are two
mounts of Mars&mdash;that immediately at the base of the Jupiter mount,
and that situated beneath Mercury mount. The mount of Luna is directly
opposite to that of Venus, which is found where the thumb joins
the wrist. (<a href="#Fig54_5">Fig. 5</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page439">[439]</span></p>

<p>In many hands it will be observed that the position of the mounts
varies. Jupiter may swell over the boundary line, and squeeze Saturn
into close proximity with Apollo, which, in its turn, may take the place
allotted to Mercury. These signs are important.</p>

<p>Jupiter&#8217;s approach to Saturn shows timidity
and self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Saturn&#8217;s approach to Apollo shows that
the creation of art and literature is tinged with
melancholy.</p>

<p>Apollo&#8217;s approach to Mercury shows
humanity, charity, and a peaceable disposition.</p>

<p>Mercury&#8217;s approach to Mars: self-reliance
and resource in danger.</p>

<p>Mars&#8217; approach to Mercury: originality, defiance,
and ability to hold one&#8217;s own against
opposition.</p>

<p>Luna inclining towards the wrist: reveries,
some frivolity and love of pleasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig54_5">

<img src="images/illo439.png" alt="" width="350" height="473" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Showing the position
of the various mounts.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A glance will reveal which bumps are most developed in the hand,
and these, taken together, are valuable keys to character.</p>

<p>Jupiter and Mercury are worldly, versatile traits.</p>

<p>Jupiter and Apollo are honest, noble traits.</p>

<p>Jupiter and Venus are somewhat selfish, vain traits.</p>

<p>Saturn and Mercury are signs that, unless among gay companions,
the individual has no power of resource.</p>

<p>These mounts are generally prominent in the hands of those who
depend entirely upon others for their amusement, and have developed
no powers by which to create a world of their own. They are shallow,
discontented persons as a rule, unable to concentrate their minds on
books or music.</p>

<p>Saturn and Mars: a thrifty temperament, verging on the avaricious.</p>

<p>Saturn and Luna: hypersensitiveness, distrust of self. A nature
which is distressed, and rendered almost morbid by the sadder side of
life, art, and literature.</p>

<p>Apollo and Luna: extreme imaginative force.</p>

<p>Apollo and Mars: in a creative hand show an inclination to depict
the strong things of life, a certain amount of realism in portrayals. A
love of danger and adventure.</p>

<p>Mercury and Mars: a superabundant amount of fun and good
spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page440">[440]</span></p>

<p>Mercury and Venus: a gay, somewhat heartless, temperament.</p>

<p>Mercury and Luna make a humorist.</p>

<p>Venus and Apollo: a charitable, generous individual.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Phalanges</span></h3>

<p>Each finger has three divisions, known as the phalanges, and these
are supposed to represent three worlds.</p>

<p>The first, which includes the nail, stands for the spiritual.</p>

<p>The second stands for the intellectual.</p>

<p>The third stands for the material.</p>

<p>Correct comparison of these phalanges provides the orbit of thoughts
and ambitions in which the mind of the individual revolves, and when
one of these predominates in length over the others, that quality for
which it stands is the principal quality possessed, although a further
study of the hand may contradict these attributes, or render them more
excessive.</p>

<p>For this reason the student is warned not to form his judgment by
one indication only. He can arrive at no reliable solution to the riddle
of character until he has studied every portion of the hand and linked
together the various peculiarities it expresses.</p>

<p>The thumb is, as it were, the figurehead of the hand. There is
more character to be discerned in its form, habitual attitude, phalanges,
and the space between it and the first finger, than in any other signs
conveyed by the physical formation of the rest. The first phalange
indexes strength or weakness of will power, constancy or fickleness,
affection or coldness of disposition. The second phalange shows by
what degree of reason the will is guided. Should it be much thinner
towards the base than at the apex, a certain degree of narrow-minded,
one-sided views is indicated.</p>

<p>The third phalange represents emotions. The two angles stand for
music, and are strongly marked upon the thumb of the musician and
composer. The first indicates time, the second harmony.</p>

<p>When the length of the third phalange preponderates over the first
and second, a passionate character, uncurbed by the power of will, discipline
of reason, and self-control is shown.</p>

<p>In a well-balanced, warm-hearted nature, these phalanges are in proportion.
Extreme length in the first phalange shows a tyrannical and
dogmatic will, which will surely prove a stumbling-block through
life, unless the thumb of the right hand modifies this natural
obstinacy.</p>

<p>The palmist should beware of, as it were, labeling the hand. He
cannot be too cautious in reaching an ultimate conclusion. The hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page441">[441]</span>
possesses a range of complexities. Strength and weakness are mingled.
Great talents may be mitigated by signs of almost equal inefficiency.
Therefore all the links of circumstances and character depicted should
be consolidated into a chain before the exponent ventures to voice his
convictions.</p>

<p>The left hand indicates natural tendencies; the right shows how far
the good and bad propensities of the individual have been developed.
It is possible that the former may represent an intellectual type which
the latter does not verify. For instance, a clear and unbroken head
line in the left hand may be marred and broken in the right, thus
showing that ability in this direction has
been neglected; or it may be that an inefficient
head line in the left palm continues
clear and deep on the right; and
the conclusion arrived at is, of course,
that, by dogged will and perseverance,
inherent incompetency has gradually been
remedied.</p>

<p>Upon the palm six important lines are
inscribed, as shown in <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Fig54_6">Fig. 6</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>The life line</i>, which forms a semicircle
at the base of the thumb.</p>

<p><i>The head line</i>, which traverses the palm,
and forms an angle with the life line.</p>

<p><i>The heart line</i>, which runs above and
parallel with the head line.</p>

<p><i>The fate line</i>, which runs horizontally
from Mount Saturn to the wrist.</p>

<p><i>The Apollo or fortune line</i>, which runs
parallel with the fate line from Mount Apollo to Mount Luna.</p>

<p><i>The line of health</i>, which forms an angle with the base of the life
line, and reaches almost to Mount Mercury.</p>

<p><i>The ring of Saturn</i>, reaching from Mount Apollo to Mount Jupiter.</p>

<p><i>The line of intuition</i>, curving from Mount Mercury to Mount Luna.</p>

<p>Upon the depth, direction, and length of these lines the vitality,
health, affections, future, finances, general tendencies of disposition and
circumstances of the subject may be arrived at.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;The principal lines of the
palm.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The manifestation of stars and islands, dots, grilles, and chains are
indications of misfortune, obstacles, ill-health, and domestic unhappiness.
Triangles, squares, clear-cut crosses, when not formed on or by
the lines of the hands, and circles on the mounts, are fortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page442">[442]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Signs&mdash;and Wonders!</span></h3>

<p>The age of the subject is arrived at in the following manner. Divide
the fate line, call the point of division 30. The age of 10 is slightly
above the base of Luna. From 10 to 50 the line should be partitioned
into equal parts; after that, however, the distances lessen.</p>

<p>The life line may also be used to calculate age, but here the method
of calculation is reversed, for childhood is above the thumb, and old
age is indicated by the length of the curve to the wrist.</p>

<p>Doubtless the most interesting marks to be found among the minor
lines of the hand, such as indicate voyages, change of environment,
talents and ambitions, are those which concern the attachments, love
affairs, and future marriage of the subject.</p>

<p>These are the influence lines, which may be discerned running from
Mount Luna to the line of Fate, from Mount Venus to the line of
Life, and on the Mount of Mercury. Their depth, length, and clearness
depend upon the enduring nature of the sentiment involved. When
crossed, barred, or cut, they demonstrate the fact that difficulties and
opposition from parents, friends, or relatives are to be encountered,
or it may be that the influence was merely a fleeting infatuation, what
is commonly known as &#8220;calf-love,&#8221; which time and deeper development
of the character have annihilated.</p>

<p>These signs should be compared with the age calculated upon the
fate line&mdash;it will then be discovered whether the influence lines are of
the past, present, or future; only constant practice and experience
can aid the exponent to a correct estimate of the period of these
happenings.</p>

<p>It may happen that the hand of a man or woman under thirty years
of age shows no indication of any of these influences, but this does not
mean that love and matrimony will never happen to them, for these
lines are sometimes late in appearance and may be found years after.</p>

<p>An island situated on an influence line is extremely unfortunate,
for it means either that marriage will be rendered impossible by the
ill-health of the subject, or that the man to whom she is engaged is
fickle or worthless in character. Likewise, it is unfortunate for Mercury&#8217;s
influence lines to terminate on the heart line, for this foretells
bereavement and widowhood. Should it cross the heart line and run
towards Venus, a separation is almost certain to culminate the alliance.</p>

<p>Nearly all the lines traversing Mount Luna are attachments or
influences connected with the opposite sex. When they rise from
the life line, they may stand for close friends or relatives of the same
sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page443">[443]</span></p>

<p>Another important group of lines may be discerned at the base of
the palm. The subject should rest the elbow on the table, with the
hand bent over the wrist, which is marked with &#8220;rascettes&#8221; or bracelets.
When these lines curve up towards the palm, they signify that the
ideals, thoughts, and impulses governing the character are noble and
uplifting; when they droop to the wrist, mercenary ambitions and self-interest
are dominant. When the rascettes are creased by other lines,
a life of strenuous work is shown. When deep, smooth, and continuous&mdash;health,
wealth, and happiness.</p>

<p>In drawing-room palmistry, the palmist is often embarrassed and
kept from concentration of thought by the buzzing chatter and laughter
of friends and acquaintances, all of whom are eager to have their hands
read, and the majority of whom expect that a lightning glance is sufficient
to reveal every detail of their character and future.</p>

<p>Palms are thrust under his notice by smiling, optimistic young
people, each of whom believes implicitly that for her or him the future
is a land of honey and roses&mdash;a straight sunny path, wherein there are
no piercing thorns and sole-bruising flints.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Guileless and Good</span></h3>

<p>We all hold ourselves very dear; flaws in our natures, however
serious and detrimental to character, seem trifles light as air. We
appear to ourselves&mdash;especially when we are young&mdash;to be very good
and guileless. We are assured that all follies will be conquered, repented
of, left far behind us in the land of oblivion, long before old
age catches us in the hip and thigh. And the palmist will often find
that those who clamor most loudly for frank and impartial revelations
are just those who are wounded by a single word that jars their self-esteem
or questions the high price set upon their individual qualities.</p>

<p>For this reason he must go gently, speaking without flattery or
undue censure, and upon such occasions he would do well to keep his
mind from diving beneath the surface of the trivial pleasant prophecies
expected of him. He should never wound the susceptibilities of some
nervous, high-strung soul by prophesying ill-health, bereavement, or
death.</p>

<p>The more serious side of the science can be dealt with only when
the exponent and subject are secure from prying eyes and listening
ears, and even then the palmist should be the very embodiment of tact,
sympathy, and discretion.</p>

<p>Should the subject really desire the probings of some past secret
misfortune, the palmist may voice his interpretation of the history written
in his hand, but, in a manner of humane and tender kindness, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page444">[444]</span>
much of the lighter side, and endeavoring to encourage and help by
faith in a happier future.</p>

<p>To blurt out some past tragedy or foretell one before others is a
wanton cruelty of which the palmist should never be guilty. He
should always endeavor to put himself in the place of the subject, and
even when the latter is, as often happens to be the case, incredulous
of his powers and eager to show his ignorance, the palmist should not
allow himself to be stung to retort by revealing a jealously-guarded
secret.</p>

<p>The physician, the clergyman, the lawyer are the recipients of pathetic
and strange confidences; the palmist will also discover many, and must
ever hold them as inviolably.</p>

<p>He must be a gentleman in the highest sense of the word&mdash;honorable,
chivalrous, humane; and, whenever the opportunity occurs, strong to encourage
the weak and console and comfort the men and women, both
young and old, whose hands reveal their heart-break, weariness, and sense
of failure.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LV</b><br />
PHRENOLOGY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Estate &#8220;Under the Hat&#8221;</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Phrenology</span> is that science which may be said to provide a chart or
map for the discovery of the treasures existing in the &#8220;estate under the
hat.&#8221; It is of Greek origin (<i>phren</i>, the mind; and <i>logos</i>, science), and is
closely allied to craniology (Gr.: <i>kranion-logos</i>, skull-science).</p>

<p>The difference between these terms is as follows:&mdash;<i>Craniology</i> is a
mere acquaintance with the skull. <i>Phrenology</i> is a full and detailed
knowledge of its contents.</p>

<p>This study is not founded on superstition, and the phrenologist is
neither charlatan nor magician, for, just as a man&#8217;s mind may be
revealed by the contour of his features,
the twitching or tightening of his lips,
a frowning or smoothing of the brows,
so the physical formation of his skull
reveals the propensities, talents, virtues,
and weaknesses peculiar to his
nature. The thin leather of a bulging
purse indicates an amount of coin; a
closer observation demonstrates of
what this coin is composed&mdash;cents,
dimes, or dollars&mdash;and in the same way
the skin of the skull bulges, and close
study and knowledge of the locality of
its developments show the various
qualities endowed.</p>

<p>The student must possess a chart
(<a href="#Fig55_1">Fig. 1</a>), and memorize it before he
essays to indicate character by means of phrenology, for its kingdoms
are as well defined as the counties on a map.</p>

</div><!--classes-->

<p>The student will at first find considerable difficulty in determining
the exact position of the different faculties. It is only by close study
of his chart, practice on human heads, and experience, that he will
at length achieve unerring ability to distinguish, blend, and separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page449">[449]</span>
the different characters, inclinations, intellects, and emotions with which
the human mind is gifted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bald-Pated Friends</span></h3>

<p>In case the would-be phrenologist is not possessed of an amiable,
bald-headed relation, he should endeavor to ingratiate himself in the
favors of a hairless friend, for there is nothing so excellent for practice
as a thatchless skull. Indeed, he is fortunate who has a large circle
of bald-pated friends and acquaintances, for, even if he dare not attempt
to find out their qualities by the sense of touch, he may achieve much
by observation.</p>

<p>Women&#8217;s heads are the most difficult to examine, and never should
the student exhibit his art on the well-coiffured damsel. There deception
lies, for what seems to him an abnormal development of &#8220;bumps&#8221;
will in all probability be artificial pads used by the fair one to discipline
her tresses into fashion&#8217;s latest erection, to say nothing of hairpins
and many other mysteries which the mind of a man, be he ever so
learned in phrenology, can never hope to fathom.</p>

<p>The woman who is really curious to have her faculties read must
consent to unpin her locks, so that the hand of the phrenologist may
come in contact with her head; and he must possess a sensitive touch,
which quickly discerns the different developments of the skull.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Phrenologist&mdash;and Man!</span></h3>

<p>Students of phrenology will be astonished to find what a great deal
of information may be gained by means of careful observation, when
actual investigation is impossible. No opportunity should be lost of
studying shape, poise, and balance of the human head. From the
temples and brows of the man occupying the same seat on an omnibus
a great deal is to be learnt, in spite of his headgear; the faculties 1, 2,
3, 5, 7, 9, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 35 will probably protrude,
and demonstrate what degree of love of form, size, individuality,
eventuality, alimentiveness, destructiveness, vitativeness, conjugality,
and amativeness exist in his nature.</p>

<p>Churches, concert rooms, and theaters abound with opportunities
for the scrutiny of masculine heads, and upon each is engraved those
abstract qualities furnished by the memorized chart.</p>

<p>The phrenologist should take pains to keep his hands and nails
perfectly clean. He should bathe them between each experiment, as
the natural grease of the hair soils them, and no one likes to have his
skull touched by unclean fingers. It is essential for him to possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page450">[450]</span>
and cultivate a buoyant disposition, which will tend to help and encourage
him, and not to condemn a subject for the weaknesses of character
he discovers.</p>

<p>Few ills have no cure. This is as true of mental inefficiency as of
physical ailments, and the prophecies of the humane phrenologist are
set in the major and not the minor key. Every individual, however
seemingly worthless or uninteresting, possesses some divine gift,
which perhaps lies dormant and neglected through his ignorance of its
existence. Here it is that the phrenologist is able to let a chink of
light penetrate the darkness, and a few kind, judicious words will do
much to bring back the latent self-respect to him who has despaired
of being released from the fetters of evil habits, intemperance, sloth, or
indifference to the liberty of wholesome well-being.</p>

<p>The motto of the student should be never to condemn. When he
has once reached the secret of identity, he should set himself to appeal
and rouse the dying spirit of manhood to a new resurrection of power
and achievement, for probably adverse and bitter circumstances, heredity,
and poverty have done much to batter down the higher nature
and develop the baser qualities of the man whose faculties he examines;
and he can only dimly imagine, but never fathom, the strength of
the temptations that warp the various molds in which the human mind
is set.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Humorous Side of Phrenology</span></h3>

<p>In drawing-room exhibitions, only the lighter side of phrenology
should be dealt with. A fund of humor and wit can be demonstrated
here, so that instruction is blended with amusement, and it is not unfitting
to use animals as illustrations of different qualities. For instance,
the refrain in the once-popular lyric, &#8220;But the cat came back,&#8221; clearly
testifies that this animal possessed the nodosity of inhabitiveness to
a marked degree. Not so the man of music-hall fame whose pathetic
pleading, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t take me home,&#8221; stirs our heartstrings most
potently, or &#8220;Bill Bailey,&#8221; the wanderer. The small dog that ogles
a larger comrade engaged with a bone, but who fears his mightier
powers too greatly to venture open attack, possesses &#8220;cupboard&#8221; affection
rather than amativeness.</p>

<p>The blinkered horse, were it granted speech, would doubtless demonstrate
the fact that it has cultivated the faculty of spirituality in no
small degree, for its sense of the unseen is remarkable.</p>

<p>The bull has only to kick up his heels and lower his horns at a
red parasol to vindicate his apt discernment of color. The manner in
which the watch-dog registers the shape of his enemy&#8217;s calves in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page451">[451]</span>
memory is a truly astonishing sign of his sense of form and locality.
The serpent&#8217;s feline smile at the bird is eloquent of its sociability and
expectation; its glistening coils are the personification of blandness
and invitation to embrace. Stay-at-home oysters are famous for
domesticity. The fish swallowing the hooked worm illustrates a beautiful
trust and faith in the providential plans man culminates for his
welfare. In the hobbled ass, wandering over and over his patch of
grass, economy, adhesiveness, and a very praiseworthy amount of application
are shown.</p>

<p>It might be well for the ambitious phrenologist to study the skulls
of these and other animals, birds, and fishes, for in these the unadulterated
essences of virtues and vices and instinctive propensities are discovered.
The human head may be likened to a very rich pudding composed
of very different ingredients, flavorings, and strata of coloring,
and sugared with conventionalities and hypocrisies. The animal, on
the contrary, exhibits its true qualities as frankly as a sirloin of raw
beef suspended in a butcher&#8217;s window.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LVI</b><br />
TELLING FORTUNES BY CARDS, DICE,
DOMINOES, ETC.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">What the Future has in Store</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no more amusing diversion for a frivolous half-hour&#8217;s entertainment
than that of fortune-telling by cards. Young or old enjoy it,
and with a ready tongue the combinations presented may be so varied
that quite surprisingly good predictions can be made.</p>

<p>Surround the whole business with as much mystery as possible.
Insist that all shuffling be done by the subject himself, and that cutting
is always carried out with the <i>left</i> hand.</p>

<p>Learn the meanings of the cards by heart. This is not difficult,
and by doing so one is enabled to tell a fortune <i>quickly</i>: always a more
impressive proceeding than telling it card by card.</p>

<p>These are the generally accepted meanings of the <span class="nowrap">cards:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clubs</span></h3>

<p>Ace of Clubs, <i>wealth and prosperity</i>. King of Clubs, <i>upright</i>,
<i>affectionate</i>. Queen of Clubs, <i>deeply in love</i>. Knave of Clubs, <i>generous
and sincere</i>. Ten of Clubs, <i>a fortune from an unexpected quarter</i>. Nine
of Clubs, <i>obstinacy</i>; <i>disputes with friends</i>. Eight of Clubs, <i>a love of
money</i>. Seven of Clubs, <i>fortune and great happiness</i>. Six of Clubs,
<i>a lucrative partnership</i>. Five of Clubs, <i>marriage with a wealthy person</i>.
Four of Clubs, <i>inconstancy</i>. Three of Clubs, <i>a second or third
marriage</i>. Two of Clubs, <i>opposition</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spades</span></h3>

<p>Ace of Spades, <i>a love affair</i>; <i>if reversed, a death</i>. King of Spades,
<i>an ambitious person</i>. Queen of Spades, <i>a treacherous friend</i>. Knave of
Spades, <i>indolent, but well-meaning</i>. Ten of Spades, <i>an unlucky card</i>.
Nine of Spades, <i>the worst card in the pack</i>; <i>sickness, or loss of fortune</i>.
Eight of Spades, <i>opposition from friends</i>. Seven of Spades, <i>sorrow</i>.
Six of Spades, <i>great fortune</i>. Five of Spades, <i>success</i>; <i>a happy marriage</i>.
Four of Spades, <i>illness</i>; <i>small loss of money</i>. Three of Spades,
<i>an unfortunate marriage</i>. Two of Spades, <i>a death</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page453">[453]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hearts</span></h3>

<p>Ace of Hearts, <i>pleasure</i>; <i>if with Spades, quarreling</i>; <i>if with Diamonds,
news of an absent friend</i>; <i>if with Clubs, merry-making</i>. King
of Hearts, <i>nice, but hasty and passionate</i>. Queen of Hearts, <i>fair, affectionate</i>.
Knave of Hearts, <i>the subject&#8217;s dearest friend</i>. Ten of Hearts,
<i>the antidote of bad cards that lie near it, but confirming the good</i>.
Nine of Hearts, <i>wealth</i>; <i>this is also the wish card</i>. Eight of Hearts,
<i>feasting and merry-making</i>. Seven of Hearts, <i>fickle</i>. Six of Hearts,
<i>generous, easily imposed upon</i>. Five of Hearts, <i>waverer, changeable</i>.
Four of Hearts, <i>marriage late in life</i>. Three of Hearts, <i>imprudent</i>;
<i>hot-headed action, which has disastrous consequences</i>. Two of Hearts,
<i>extraordinary success and good fortune</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diamonds</span></h3>

<p>Ace of Diamonds, <i>a letter; the card next to it will indicate its nature</i>.
King of Diamonds, <i>hot tempered</i>. Queen of Diamonds, <i>a coquette</i>.
Knave of Diamonds, <i>a selfish person</i>. Ten of Diamonds, <i>money</i>.
Nine of Diamonds, <i>a roving person</i>. Eight of Diamonds, <i>marriage late
in life</i>. Seven of Diamonds, <i>a gambler</i>. Six of Diamonds, <i>early marriage</i>.
Five of Diamonds, <i>friendship</i>. Four of Diamonds, <i>unhappy
marriage</i>. Three of Diamonds, <i>quarrels, lawsuits, and disagreements</i>.
Two of Diamonds, <i>a serious love affair</i>.</p>

<p>There are two effective ways of fortune-telling.</p>

<p>For the first, ask your subject to shuffle the cards very thoroughly
and to wish all the time. Then cut them into three piles with the left
hand. Should the wish card (the Nine of Hearts) be one of those cut,
it is a lucky omen.</p>

<p>Notice two other cards and their possible bearing on the wish. Now,
after lifting the cards and putting them together with the left hand,
proceed to divide them into piles in this fashion.</p>

<p>The first pile is to yourself. The second, to the house. The third,
to your wish. The fourth, what you do expect. The fifth, what you
don&#8217;t expect. The sixth, sure to come true. The seventh foretells the
happenings of to-night.</p>

<p>Arrange these piles, as you deal out the cards one by one, in a semicircle.
Then proceed to read them off by their meanings.</p>

<p>Another and rather more complicated method is to ask the person
whose fortune is being told which King he will be (if it is a woman,
one would naturally ask which Queen).</p>

<p>After the wishing has been done as before, the fortune-teller lays
out the cards in rows&mdash;seven in a row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page454">[454]</span></p>

<p>To read the fortune the teller must start from the King or Queen
chosen, counting seven from him or her in every case.</p>

<p>The King or Queen of the same suit will always be the lover or
sweetheart of the one whose fortune is being told, and the Knave being
their thoughts, it is, of course, quite easy to discover their feelings.</p>

<p>It is rather a good plan to write the meanings of the cards on an
old pack. By using this a few times a rapid flow of ideas will much
more readily be induced. It might be mentioned that a too strict adherence
to rule is by no means either necessary or desirable in fortune-telling.
Tell what the combination of cards suggests to you&mdash;quite
irrespective of the exact meaning of each&mdash;and you will be infinitely
more amusing and obtain much greater fame as a wizard.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig56_2">Fig. 2</a> shows three cards which might conceivably come together

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page455">[455]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig56_3">Fig. 3</a> conveys the following:&mdash;You will get a letter (Ace of Diamonds)
about money (Ten of Diamonds). Your good fortune, however,
will not permit you to marry until late in life (Eight of Diamonds).
The five cards representing <a href="#Fig56_4">Fig. 4</a> tell that the subject&#8217;s
dearest friend (Knave of Hearts) will make the acquaintance of a flirt
(Queen of Diamonds), and will shortly after suffer illness or slight loss
of money (Four of Spades), but afterwards he will fall in love with
a fair affectionate woman (Queen of Hearts) and enjoy extraordinary
success (Two of Hearts).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Throw of the Dice</span></h3>

<p>Although forecasting of the future from dice is one of the most
ancient methods of prediction, it is curiously enough almost unknown
in modern days. For this reason it is of special value to the home entertainer,
and will prove infinitely simpler than the cards, the meanings
being easier to learn as well as fewer in number.</p>

<p>First chalk a magic circle on the table, then obtain a small cup or
box to shake the dice in.</p>

<p>Three dice only should be used.</p>

<p>The person whose future is at stake must shake and cast the dice
in the circle. This, as in card fortune-telling, should be done with the
left hand.</p>

<p>Three tells you of an approaching accident; four, a rise in your
position; five, that you will make the acquaintance of one who will
be a friend; six, predicts loss; seven, a scandal; eight, a reproach&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page456">[456]</span>
is not undeserved; nine, a wedding; ten, a christening; eleven,
trouble for one you love; twelve, an important letter; thirteen, tears;
fourteen, beware of an enemy; fifteen, good luck and happiness; sixteen,
a journey; seventeen, a water journey; three sixes, or eighteen
points, is a very good sign. It means great profit in business, or something
the person wishes for very much.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fortune-Telling by Dominoes</span></h3>

<p>A fairly unique accomplishment is to reveal the future by the aid
of dominoes, and there is something sufficiently fascinating and mysterious
about this mode of revelation to fill the uninitiated with awe at
the powers of the exponent.</p>

<p>Each small oblong has its secret meaning by which some happening<span class="pagenum" id="Page457">[457]</span>
vital to the subject is illustrated. It is a matter of little difficulty
to commit these to memory; and in this, as in other methods
of divination, the fundamental principle is that of comparison and
calculation.</p>

<p>The dominoes used range from double-six to double-blank, and by
these are symbolized the various vicissitudes of fate likely to befall
mankind. The exponent places his paraphernalia upon the table, and,
having turned them with their black spots facing the surface, proceeds
to shuffle them. When this is done, the subject is requested to draw
three pieces, one at a time. Between the choice of each the dominoes
are shuffled.</p>

<p>The first supplies an impression; should it be drawn a second time,
the impression becomes a conviction. The third, however, may lessen
or wholly contradict its degree of importance, and this is where calculation
and comparison in blending the signs are essential to a successful
justification and interpretation of these symbols.</p>

<p><i>Double-six</i> is an emblem of matrimonial happiness and financial
prosperity.</p>

<p><i>Six-five</i> is almost equally fortunate. Perseverance and concentration
are rewarded by ultimate success.</p>

<p><i>Six-four</i> implies a comfortable income, and secures happiness in
marriage.</p>

<p><i>Six-three</i> demonstrates that fate smiles upon the love and marriage
of the subject.</p>

<p><i>Six-two.</i>&mdash;Prudence, hard work, and a certain amount of good luck,
or exposure and shame for any wrong-doing.</p>

<p><i>Six-one</i> promises two marriages to the young subject, the first of
which will not be as happy as the second. Should the subject be of
middle age, this domino foretells the speedy arrival of good things and
the fact that he or she will never be left lonely and uncared for.</p>

<p><i>Six-blank</i> is, alas, a sign of great trouble&mdash;sickness, death, or heavy
money losses.</p>

<p><i>Double-five</i> presages that all achievements will be rewarded with a
large amount of success, but inordinate wealth is not prophesied.</p>

<p><i>Five-four</i> is almost as unfortunate a draw as six-blank. Should a
young girl lift it, it means that her future husband will be poor and
leave her a widow. Further, he may be of extravagant disposition, in
spite of his poverty.</p>

<p><i>Five-three</i> indicates a tranquil and contented existence. Sufficient
money and matrimonial affection of moderate strength, the couple being
incapable of passionate devotion.</p>

<p><i>Five-two</i> conveys a warning that love and marriage are destined to
an unhappy termination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page458">[458]</span></p>

<p><i>Five-one</i> portends social popularity, but financial worries and
losses.</p>

<p><i>Five-blank</i> is supposed to demonstrate egotistical and avaricious
characteristics, tendencies to swindling and intrigues, also a warning to
remain unmarried.</p>

<p><i>Double-four.</i>&mdash;The man who earns his livelihood by manual labor
may regard this domino as a sign of future security and prosperity, but
to him whose profession needs mental achievement it is rather disastrous.
Troubles and disappointments await him.</p>

<p><i>Four-three.</i>&mdash;Matrimony and moderate income.</p>

<p><i>Four-two</i> proclaims an early marriage and moderate income.</p>

<p><i>Four-one.</i>&mdash;Wealth or many friends.</p>

<p><i>Four-blank.</i>&mdash;A sure warning that single life will be the best and
happiest. It counsels that any secrets imparted to another will be indiscreetly
revealed.</p>

<p><i>Double-three.</i>&mdash;Enormous riches.</p>

<p><i>Three-two</i> foretells prosperity in matrimony, travels, and speculations.</p>

<p><i>Three-one.</i>&mdash;Some danger and unhappiness. The necessity for acting
with extreme caution in all matters.</p>

<p><i>Three-blank.</i>&mdash;Domestic unhappiness&mdash;such as a quarrel or incompatibility
of temperament of husband and wife. The absence of harmony
in the home.</p>

<p><i>Double-two</i> promises average happiness and income.</p>

<p><i>Two-one.</i>&mdash;Two marriages, if the individual be a woman; financial
failures to a commercial man.</p>

<p><i>Two-blank.</i>&mdash;The intrigues of unscrupulous persons will meet with
temporary success. It also denotes poverty, and an indolent husband.
The individual will return safely from all journeys undertaken.</p>

<p><i>Double-one.</i>&mdash;An existence free from money worries; peace and
constancy in love and marriage.</p>

<p><i>Double-blank</i> seems to favor the deeds of unprincipled persons, and
foretells want of integrity in lover and husband.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Figured Futurity</span></h3>

<p>That a certain amount of character and future may be revealed by
means of figures is a fact that may be tested for itself. The results

<p>The fortune-teller who uses the cabalistic method of revealing Destiny&#8217;s
secrets should be extremely careful to attach the correct figures
to the letters contained in the names of the subject, otherwise it is quite
obvious that his delineation will be at fault. He should add the numbers
several times to make sure they are exact. If he has a good memory,
he will memorize the table of qualities, and a great aid to this is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page461">[461]</span>
practice with it before him, manufacturing names, or taking those of
some well-known poet, author, statesman, or ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>His own name will doubtless reveal the fundamental truths of this
method, and the cognomens of well-known personages will show him
the distinguishing traits that have made them famous. For instance,

<h3><span class="smcap">Divinations by Tarocs</span></h3>

<p>Tarocs differ from the numeral cards used for bridge, whist, &amp;c.,
in several ways. A pack consists of seventy-eight cards, made up of
twenty-two emblematic pictures and fifty-six ordinary.</p>

<p>These latter are grouped into four suits of fourteen cards each:&mdash;four
<i>coat cards</i>&mdash;king, queen, chevalier, and valet; and ten <i>pip cards</i>,
numbering from 1 to 10.</p>

<p>The twenty-two emblematic cards are known as the <i>Major Arcana</i>,
and are divided into three groups of seven, which equal twenty-one cards.
The twenty-second stands for the highest point successful achievement
may reach. The <i>Major Arcana</i> <span class="nowrap">contains:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that seventy-eight cards divide equally in the first deal.</p>

<p>In the second deal, however, only fifty-one cards are used, so that
there is one over. This card is shuffled with the third deal.</p>

<p>Two cards are now over, and these are placed as discards, until
the central pack of the last deal of eleven is put on the right, when they
are shuffled with the remaining twenty-two discards. The cards will now

<p>The tarocs of pack A, B, and C are now lifted separately, and placed
on the table from left to right in rows. Each taroc has its meaning,
and from its relation to its fellows the manipulator is able to present a
brief sketch of character, inclination, and futurity.</p>

<p>Another simple method is to shuffle all the cards and request the
inquirer to cut. The manipulator then proceeds to draw the first seventeen
tarocs, uncovering only the eighteenth and last card of the pack.
These two cards create what degree of sympathy is shared between
himself and his client, the keynote being given by the symbolic meaning
attached to the card. The seventeen cards are now revealed from left
to right, their interpretation being given separately. In order to reach
a proper signification, they are then compared as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LVII</b><br />
GRAPHOLOGY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Character from Handwriting</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">More</span> or less consciously, <i>every one</i> is a reader of handwriting! If
we have not devoted thought and study to the subject, we merely
gather a vaguely favorable, or unfavorable, impression from the
first letter written to us by a new acquaintance, and store it up
with the other impressions we have already gleaned from their
personality.</p>

<p>When, however, time and thought are given to the fascinating cult
of Graphology, it will be found to reward its students, by letting a
thousand little sidelights on to character&mdash;and if the most &#8220;proper
study of mankind is man,&#8221; then assuredly is Graphology a most helpful
adjunct to that end.</p>

<p>One must crawl before one can walk, and learn the alphabet before
one can master a language, therefore an impulsive learner must not
grow disgusted because his laborious reading of a handwriting is disjointed,
and may be obviously unlike the writer. By the time he can
read a character from a letter, <i>without gathering a word of that letter&#8217;s
sense</i>&mdash;which is what every graphologist worthy the name can, and
<i>does</i> do&mdash;he will have come to see how one sign outweighs or counterbalances
another, and so learn to read a human character from a sheet
of paper and the more or less erratic tracings of a pen.</p>

<p>As a home entertainment, any amount of fun is to be got out of
it. One unfailing source of amusement is to notice how all are willing
vaguely to accept the ownership of every failing save the one you ascribe
to them.</p>

<p>The jealous girl is &#8220;perfectly horrid,&#8221; she knows. But she certainly
&#8220;isn&#8217;t jealous.&#8221; The lazy man is &#8220;bad tempered, perhaps,&#8221; but &#8220;no
one could call him indolent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Friends and relations will, however, be ready to assure you of the
correctness of your delineation.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice when studying character from handwriting,
is the <i>direction</i> of a hand. Is it even, upward, or tending to<span class="pagenum" id="Page466">[466]</span>
meander down the page? The even hand suggests honesty, conscientiousness,
and a calm, well-balanced nature. The upward hand tells
of will power and ambition, cheerfulness and energy. The hand that
slopes downward tells of a timid and weak nature, depression and
melancholy. It must always be remembered, however, that temporary
ill-health, and even a temporary wave of depression, will frequently
alter the direction of a hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes a beginner is puzzled by the varying direction&mdash;now
upward, now downward&mdash;of a hand; generally this betokens a mind
struggling at the time with adverse circumstances or ill-health.</p>

<p>Capital letters and terminals are both important. The more
clearly formed and beautiful the letter, the more refined and artistic
the nature.</p>

<p>The graphologist picks out certain letters as being especially important&mdash;<i>M</i>,
<i>A</i>, <i>L</i>, and <i>D</i> in the capital letters. The small <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>
in terminal letters are certainly the most important.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Principal Letters</span></h3>

<p>Taken in alphabetical order, the following are the principal letters
to <span class="nowrap">study:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well made, and simple in outline, indicates refinement, gentleness,
intelligence, perhaps poetic feelings. Flourishes are always bad,
and tell of pretension and egotism. If a small <i>a</i> is unjoined&mdash;open-mouthed
as it were&mdash;the subject is something of a gossip. This also
applies to the small <i>o</i>.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="figcenter w250">

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p><i>B.</i> This is a letter that frequently tells of ostentation and kindred
failings. If the small <i>b</i> is well looped, look for an affectionate
nature.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> A well-rounded <i>C</i> shows a kindly, perhaps indolent nature. A
curly tail suggests selfishness and egotism.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> The small <i>d</i> is very truth-telling. A small <i>d</i> united to the letter
following shows a good sequence of ideas. Too much flourish tells
of an ill-balanced imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page467">[467]</span></p>

<p><i>E.</i> The capital letter shows egotism, even as the letter <i>C</i> does, in
the curled back tail. A long tail to the small <i>e</i> tells of imagination,
good-nature, ardor; if exaggerated, carelessness.</p>

<p><i>M</i> is the next really important letter&mdash;in some respects <i>the</i> most
important. The first high loop means ambition, pride, discontent. A
big flourish to the termination shows egotism; a moderate one force
of character.</p>

<p><i>T</i>, or rather the particular method of crossing the <i>T</i>, is always
of immense interest to the graphologist. Energy, strength of will,
temper, perseverance, obstinacy, may all be shown or found to be
lacking. The thickly crossed <i>T</i> indicates energy; the little hook back
at the end, perseverance; a thick abrupt ending, temper. Impulsive
people cross their <i>T</i>&#8217;s high. Those who make long bars are energetic
and quick in thinking.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split6733-->

<p>Wide spacing between lines suggests extravagant tastes; accompanied
by rounded terminals to the letters, good-nature and generosity.</p>

<p>Short tails and a tendency to make as much as possible out of a
sheet of paper, show the opposite characteristic.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misleading Signs</span></h3>

<p>It cannot be too emphatically impressed on the beginner, that it is
fatal to judge from one sign alone. Study them all ere you commit
yourself to an opinion; above all, study the signature.</p>

<p>A specimen for delineation should always consist of about six lines,
<i>not</i> of copied matter. It must be written on unlined paper, and have
the writer&#8217;s usual signature attached.</p>

<p>Never attempt to gather anything from an envelope, as one is so
often asked to do. Like copied matter, or indeed anything written
specially to order, it is hopelessly misleading.</p>

<p>Flourishes always show a certain vulgarity of mind. A small and
graceful one after the signature&mdash;particularly in the case of a woman&mdash;is,
however, quite pardonable, and is indicative merely of love of
praise and appreciation. Thick and heavy marks of punctuation are<span class="pagenum" id="Page468">[468]</span>
one of the signs of a passionate nature. Caution and careful attention
to detail are shown by stops between initials and after the signature, the
careful crossing of <i>T</i>&#8217;s and dotting of <i>I</i>&#8217;s. Frank, impulsive natures
seldom, if ever, close their <i>A</i>&#8217;s and <i>O</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550">

<img src="images/illo468a.png" alt="" width="523" height="228" />

<p class="caption">Benevolent&mdash;kind-hearted, very refined, a poor one at keeping a secret, devoted
to those she loves.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Tender-hearted people invariably slope their writing, and make long
tails and loops. The critic divides his letters. The orator and writer
invariably join theirs, and carry them on from word to word, even as
the sequence of their thoughts follows on.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">

<img src="images/illo468b.png" alt="" width="600" height="211" />

<p class="caption">Suggests an affectionate nature&mdash;one who would be greatly influenced by his friends!
Critical&mdash;rather impulsive; a good worker at things he likes. Loves beauty
and can keep his own counsel.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>As a general rule, the more charmingly clear the handwriting, the
more straightforward and cultivated the person. <i>Eccentricity</i>, however,
naturally mars many of the cleverest hands.</p>

<p>It will perhaps simplify matters for the student, if a list is compiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page469">[469]</span>
of the principal human virtues and failings, and the means of discovering
them by the handwriting, <span class="nowrap">described:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Ambition.</i>&mdash;This is shown in the upward tendency of the hand.
Should will power be lacking, expect discontent.</p>

<p><i>Business.</i>&mdash;A businesslike person is always to be recognized by the
care of such details as stops, spacing, crossing of <i>T</i>&#8217;s, the general air
of law and order in the hand. Look for perseverance and will power to
insure success.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500">

<img src="images/illo469.png" alt="" width="500" height="191" />

<p class="caption">Diplomatic, lacking in will power, possessing extravagant tastes, greatly
influenced by the opposite sex.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Brutality.</i>&mdash;Thick, heavy, ungraceful handwriting, impulsive and
lacking in intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Candor.</i>&mdash;Clear, well-spaced lines and open rounded letters. Well
and firmly crossed <i>T</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i>&mdash;See <i>Business</i>.</p>

<p><i>Coldness.</i>&mdash;Upright hand, closed up letters, no graceful &#8220;loop.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Criticism.</i>&mdash;This is often found allied to a good sequence of ideas.
The separated letters of criticism and the carried on <i>T</i> crosses, &amp;c.,
betray the quick thinker.</p>

<p><i>Deceit.</i>&mdash;This is always indicated by the screwed-up, badly-formed
letters, that run into one another; lines uneven, and words that trail
off into a mere scrawl.</p>

<p><i>Determination</i> is shown by the firmly crossed <i>T</i>, and the general
firmness of the whole handwriting.</p>

<p><i>Eccentricity.</i>&mdash;Always betrays itself in a weird signature. Economy,
short tails; careful hand, short terminals.</p>

<p><i>Egotism.</i>&mdash;Look for a flourish&mdash;for the curl back in capital <i>C</i>&#8217;s and
<i>E</i>&#8217;s; for the curled back small <i>d</i>.</p>

<p><i>Extravagance.</i>&mdash;Wide margins and spacing, a rounded, rather flourishing
hand; few stops; generally somewhat thick. Compare other
signs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page470">[470]</span></p>

<p><i>Fun.</i>&mdash;The love of fun is usually indicated by quaintly-rounded
terminals and oddly shaped, and often rather illegible capitals.</p>

<p><i>Generosity.</i>&mdash;Curled up terminals, bounded hand, <i>M</i>&#8217;s and <i>N</i>&#8217;s written
like <i>U</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Honor.</i>&mdash;Even handwriting; might almost have been written over
lines. <i>See</i> Candor; and for honesty also.</p>

<p><i>Imagination.</i>&mdash;Good capitals; small <i>d</i>&#8217;s joined to following letter
bear a hurried look; flying crosses to <i>T</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Indolence.</i>&mdash;Bounded hand; short terminals.</p>

<p><i>Intelligence.</i>&mdash;Shown by the small attractive hand; clear and firm
good capitals.</p>

<p><i>Jealousy.</i>&mdash;A weak hand; sloping, long-looped, flyaway <i>T</i>&#8217;s; egotistic
<i>C</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Loyalty.</i>&mdash;Of course you cannot expect to find much character in
handwriting until the age of seventeen or so, but the lad who is
loyal to his friends and his sense of duty&mdash;the typical Boy Scout&#8217;s
hand, for example&mdash;will ever be found firm and boldly ascending
the sheet.</p>

<p><i>Melancholy.</i>&mdash;Downward tendency, not only to lines but even
words.</p>

<p><i>Music.</i>&mdash;Look for imagination, tenderness, and refinement.</p>

<p><i>Neatness.</i>&mdash;Easily to be seen.</p>

<p><i>Obstinacy.</i>&mdash;Heavy; crushed down as it were on an imaginary line;
thick.</p>

<p><i>Originality.</i>&mdash;Imagination marked; unique capitals and flourishes.</p>

<p><i>Pride.</i>&mdash;The exaggerated first loop to the <i>M</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">

<img src="images/illo470.png" alt="" width="600" height="119" />

<p class="caption">Possesses good sequence of ideas; clever, vivacious, good-natured and devoted.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p><i>Perseverance.</i>&mdash;Clear running hand; well crossed <i>T</i>&#8217;s, with little
hook to end their crossing.</p>

<p><i>Selfishness.</i>&mdash;Upright hand, generally heavy.</p>

<p><i>Sensitiveness.</i>&mdash;A very sloped, rather weak, and long-looped hand.</p>

<p><i>Temper.</i>&mdash;Thickly crossed, flying <i>T</i>&#8217;s; uneven and rather angular
handwriting.</p>

<p><i>Truth.</i>&mdash;See <i>Candor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page471">[471]</span></p>

<p><i>Vanity.</i>&mdash;Look for flourish beneath signature.</p>

<p><i>Will Power.</i>&mdash;Straight thick little bar under signature; thickly
crossed <i>T</i>&#8217;s; purposeful-looking hand; no return to tails of <i>G</i>&#8217;s
and <i>Y</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In conclusion, one might truthfully say that the more closely one
studies the handwriting of one&#8217;s friends, the more converted must one
become to the belief in Graphology. Go slowly. Compare carefully.
Remember always that human beings inevitably suffer from the faults
of their qualities, therefore search and you will be rewarded by the
enthusiasm of those to whom you give your delineations.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LVIII</b><br />
A SUCCESSFUL CHILDREN&#8217;S PARTY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Word to Grown-Ups</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is undoubtedly one of the hardest tasks imaginable to give a successful
children&#8217;s party, and the reasons that militate against success are
legion.</p>

<p>In the first place children are the keenest of critics; secondly, that
which interests a mite of three will bring boredom unmitigated to the
&#8220;fellow of ten,&#8221; while the maiden of twelve and the &#8220;man&#8221; of fifteen
have very strong views of their own on the subject of amusements.</p>

<p>A children&#8217;s party, then, is not an undertaking to be approached
lightly. It is of course an easy matter to hire the services of a ventriloquist
or a conjurer or some public entertainer for the afternoon,
and leave the rest to luck, yet how many hostesses have come to grief
on the rocks of such an enterprise.</p>

<p>And let it be remembered that it is an absolute impossibility to
provide an entertainment that will appeal equally to children ranging
from three to fifteen. Only a section will appreciate the show. Far
better to let the youngsters be their own entertainers.</p>

<p>It may of course be presumed that no one will dream of giving a
children&#8217;s party who is the occupant of a very small house. Twenty
children want more room than fifty adults. This is a truism that cannot
be too strongly emphasized.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon the date for your party and having sent out the
invitations, you will, wise general that you are, take complete stock
of your field of campaign, and make up your mind that at least four
rooms will have to be more or less gutted to receive the host of youthful
invaders you are about to summon forth.</p>

<p>Let it be supposed that you have in your house three sitting-rooms.
The dining-room will be the refreshment room, the parlor, stripped
of all breakables and needless accessories, for the older children to play
in, the morning room to be converted into a dressing-room. Upstairs
it will be as well to transform a bedroom into a play-room for the tiny
tots and their nurses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page473">[473]</span></p>

<p>There is one fatal mistake that hostesses are sometimes guilty of
in giving a children&#8217;s party,&mdash;they ask their guests to come too early
and send them away too late. The secret of success with children lies
in the one hackneyed sentence: &#8220;Enough is as good as a feast.&#8221; Children
are easily tired, and they can crowd into three hours as much
healthy enjoyment as would certainly not be the case were another hour
to be given them. If your young guests leave you with regret you do
not want any more thanks; if they fly to get their coats and hats, all
your labors, no matter how sincere and arduous they may have been,
will have been spent in vain.</p>

<p>From four till seven <span class="allcaps smcap">P.M.</span> will be found quite long enough, with
tea at half-past four. Here again lies another fatal pitfall. <i>Avoid
kickshaws!</i>&mdash;digestion-ruining cream cakes and jam puffs particularly.
Bread and butter, chocolate biscuits, plain cakes, and sponge cakes produce
no ill effects. Such advice as this may provoke a scornful laugh
from the would-be hostess who reads these lines. &#8220;Teach me how to
feed children!&#8221; I hear her say. &#8220;What presumption!&#8221; Yet it is
homely advice that is the most useful, the most disregarded when all
is said and done.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tea Time</span></h3>

<p>Half-past four will be found a good time for tea. Soon after five
the healthiest hunger will have been appeased, and then, having &#8220;let
digestion wait on appetite,&#8221; marshal your guests into the drawing-room
and allow them to &#8220;fall to&#8221; to amuse themselves.</p>

<p>Let the revels be of the simplest. If there is one game children
love more than another it is Musical Chairs, and as there cannot be a
person living, who does not know that historic pastime, there will be
no need to describe it in detail.</p>

<p>However, among your young guests you will be sure to find one
or two boys who do not care to play the game, yet who can be made
exceedingly useful in another way as &#8220;umpires.&#8221; Most boys of fourteen
or fifteen have a great sense of honor when games are under consideration;
let two boys, then, be the arbiters of the sport&mdash;let them
decide whether, when the music stopped, Tommy found a seat before
Johnny, or whether Billy was too rough when he pushed Mary aside
and took the seat that should have been hers. You will have no need
to grumble at the impartiality or the reverse of the young umpires.</p>

<p>After Musical Chairs, what better than Blind Man&#8217;s Buff, a game that
never stales, made more exciting if &#8220;Buff,&#8221; after having caught a
victim, fails to identify his prey, and must therefore pay a forfeit to
be chosen by his captive? Children love forfeits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page474">[474]</span></p>

<p>Hissing and Clapping, Dumb Crambo, Acting Proverbs&mdash;there is
no end to the games that children love. And let them choose their
own. You will add a thousandfold to the success of your party if
you allow your guests to please themselves, and by so doing you will
give yourself far more pleasure than would be the case if you &#8220;fussed
about&#8221; arranging, directing, ordering. Children love responsibility as
much as &#8220;grown-ups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Above all, remember that &#8220;Boys will be boys.&#8221; It is only with
the greatest tact that you will be able to eliminate the boisterous element,
which will crop up now and again in the best regulated parties. If
you can enlist in your services some jolly bachelor who loves children,
and who can romp with them as a child, you will have solved the problem
of keeping down the rowdy element. A man of this stamp can
work wonders with an obstreperous youngster, can smooth out the
creases in your handiwork, can keep things at concert pitch, and if at
the end of the party he is a worn-out and exhausted wreck&mdash;being who
he is, he won&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>So seven o&#8217;clock comes. The time for farewells has arrived. Wraps
and coats must be put on, and the little ones, flushed, excited, happy,
are dispatched to their various homes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much, it has been fun.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a ripping
time, thank you.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s been splendid.&#8221; Such thanks as these will
repay you for three hours of babel and pandemonium, for all the forethought
and tact you have brought to bear on a by no means too easy
task.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page475">[475]</span></p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LIX</b><br />
PARLOR GAMES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">For Christmas Parties</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Christmas parties, at which guests of all ages are found, it is sometimes
a perplexing riddle to the hostess to know how to entertain them
all. Musical items which may delight the older members of the company
may only serve to render younger folk restless and dull, and
dancing is not always possible in rooms of limited size. Moreover,
there are still many young folk who are unable to set their feet nimbly
to waltz and two-step, and would much prefer a romp to whirling round
in time to a measure.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness and shyness are usually very evident when the
party enters the drawing-room, and this coating of ice, if not thawed
quickly, will rapidly freeze into impenetrable restraint and gloom. At
such times a good game, quickly organized, is invaluable. The rules
should be explained by the hostess in so simple a manner that the
youngest person present can follow them, and everything necessary
should be arranged beforehand to avoid awkward delays and pauses.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Clothes-pin Game</span></h3>

<p>The players are formed into two lines a few feet apart; at the top
and bottom of the lines are two tables upon which as many pins as
there are players are placed, and exactly divided into two heaps. The
hands of all are crossed at the wrists. The first players of each line
use the second player&#8217;s right hand to pick up a pin. The latter in the
same way passes it to the next player, and in this manner it goes
through the lines to the table at the end, upon which the last players
place it. Meanwhile, of course, the first players are sending other pins
down the rows.</p>

<p>The line that succeeds in removing all the pins in the heap from
one table to the other in the shortest time wins the game. The fun lies
in the awkward manipulation of one&#8217;s neighbor&#8217;s hand. Should a pin
be dropped in the process, it must be picked up by the umpire and<span class="pagenum" id="Page476">[476]</span>
returned to the top table, and throughout the game the wrists must be
kept crossed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span></h3>

<p>One of the party retires while the rest decide upon a well-known
proverb. When he returns, he stands in the center of a semicircle.
Some one taps three times with a stick, and at the third tap each player
shouts one word of the proverb loudly and simultaneously. This is
repeated three times, and it is amazing how difficult it is to distinguish
even the most well-known proverb in the uproar.</p>

<p>Should one word give the key to the player not in the secret, the
individual who speaks it takes his place. For instance, in the proverb,
&#8220;All is not gold that glitters,&#8221; it may happen that the word &#8220;glitters&#8221;
provides the keynote. Therefore, he or she who speaks it takes the
place of the one who guesses.</p>

<p>The proverb must contain as many words as there are players, and
each shouts only the one word allotted to him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Shadows</span></h3>

<p>A white sheet is stretched against the wall, with a lamp immediately
before it. All other lights are extinguished. One of the company sits
on a chair or stool with eyes fixed on the sheet. Behind him the company
files noiselessly, the while he endeavors to identify them by means
of the shadows silhouetted on the screen.</p>

<p>Simple disguises are allowable and increase the fun. For example,
a boy may don a girl&#8217;s hat, a girl a boy&#8217;s; or a skirt or shawl may be
draped over a boy&#8217;s suit, thus concealing the wearer&#8217;s identity. The
one whose shadow betrays her takes the place of the player who identifies
her.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gardeners</span></h3>

<p>Two rows, headed by a chosen captain, face each other. In turn
they fire at each other the names of vegetable, flowers, or fruit, beginning
with the letter A, and using in turn the other letters of the alphabet&mdash;asparagus,
artichokes, apples, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The players on each side set their wits to work to aid their captain
when he shows signs of faltering. They are not allowed to speak aloud,
their promptings being given in whispers, and this is where the fun
comes in, for, when one is excited and eager to give a word, it is very
difficult to remember to whisper, especially when placed at the tail of
the line.</p>

<p>When a gardener and his side pause to remember a word the<span class="pagenum" id="Page477">[477]</span>
opposite side counts twenty slowly; if at the end of that time their
opponents still fail they forfeit a man. The game goes on until one
captain has secured all his adversaries&#8217; followers. Should any one
except the leaders speak aloud, he or she is obliged to cross to the other
party.</p>

<p>When a captain surrenders he is obliged to go to the end of the
line, and the next man takes his place and responsibilities. Wild flowers
or plants are not allowed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tidings</span></h3>

<p>Each player adopts some trade or profession. One member reads
out the social gossip from a daily paper. When he pauses and points
at one of the rest, that one must reply quickly some sentence regarding
his calling or the stock he sells, for <span class="nowrap">instance&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Reader.</i>&mdash;The ball that took place at the residence of the Hon.
Mrs. Mortimer last evening was distinguished by the presence of the
President.</p>

<p>A number of d&eacute;butantes were present, the majority of whom were
dressed in&mdash;Here the reader glances at the carpenter, who answers,
&#8220;Shavings.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;Their headgear consisted of (glances at the <span class="nowrap">fruiterer)&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Fruiterer</i>&mdash;&#8220;Pine-apples.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;Their jewels were necklaces (glances at the <span class="nowrap">ironmonger)&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Ironmonger</i>&mdash;&#8220;Of nails.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;The dancing took place <span class="nowrap">in&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Tobacconist</i>&mdash;&#8220;A cigar box.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;The walls of which were richly decorated <span class="nowrap">with&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lawyer</i>&mdash;&#8220;Red tape.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;The band was composed of forty instruments <span class="nowrap">all&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;&#8220;Medicine bottles.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;The President&#8217;s first partner <span class="nowrap">was&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Fishmonger</i>&mdash;&#8220;A codfish.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;Who was most becomingly clad <span class="nowrap">in&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Druggist</i>&mdash;&#8220;Silver scales.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;Her bouquet was composed <span class="nowrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Dry Goods Merchant</i>&mdash;&#8220;Spools of cotton.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;And her tiny feet were cased <span class="nowrap">in&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Mason</i>&mdash;&#8220;Bricks.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;Her dancing was as light <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Plumber</i>&mdash;&#8220;A gas escape.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>&mdash;&#8220;And her charming smiles showed to view a perfect set
<span class="nowrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page478">[478]</span></p>

<p><i>Bootmaker</i>&mdash;&#8220;Black heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>It can be imagined from this example the merriment and laughter
similar answers evoke.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lawyer</span></h3>

<p>The party is divided into two rows, through which walks the lawyer.
He asks a number of questions, and the answers may contain any
words except &#8220;yes,&#8221; &#8220;no,&#8221; &#8220;white,&#8221; &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>

<p>The person to whom he puts his query does not reply, but the one
immediately opposite does.</p>

<p>The lawyer exchanges places with the one who makes the first
mistake.</p>

<h4><i>An Example</i></h4>

<p><i>Lawyer</i> (pointing to Mary)&mdash;&#8220;Your hair is very long; is it your
own?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> opposite bawls &#8220;false.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To Jessie</i>&mdash;&#8220;Do these pretty boots pinch your feet?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>&mdash;&#8220;Of course, they are two sizes too small.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To John</i>&mdash;&#8220;Did you use your razor this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Jane</i>&mdash;&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t any hair to cut.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To Timothy</i>&mdash;&#8220;Is your nurse waiting to put you to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Elsie</i>&mdash;&#8220;Naturally&mdash;he goes to bed at seven.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To Dick</i>&mdash;&#8220;What would you like on your next birthday?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Ethel</i>&mdash;&#8220;A rattle.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To James</i>&mdash;&#8220;What is your favorite pastime?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Alice</i>&mdash;&#8220;Putting dolly to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To Freda</i>&mdash;&#8220;What is the color of your face?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Andrew</i> (afraid to say &#8220;white&#8221; for fear of forfeit)&mdash;&#8220;Green.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbages</span></h3>

<p>Any number of players can take part in this game. They kneel in
a circle on the floor with fingers stretched out before them and thumbs
tucked in.</p>

<p>The game is started by the leader&#8217;s query to her neighbor: &#8220;Can
you play cabbages?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the latter has not been initiated into the mysteries of the game,
she at once <span class="nowrap">replies&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question is asked by each player, and is always answered in
the negative until the circle is completed, when the leader again
queries:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page479">[479]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Can you play cabbages?&#8221;</p>

<p>Neighbor&mdash;&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Leader</i> (suddenly)&mdash;&#8220;Then why on earth are we sitting here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The blank expressions which result in this query are ludicrous in
the extreme, and are followed by bursts of merriment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lover&#8217;s Coming</span></h3>

<p>All the members of the party save one are massed together at the
end of the room. The leader walks close to them, and throws a light
rubber ball towards any person she likes.</p>

<p>The person must be prepared to catch the ball. As the leader throws
it, she accompanies the action with these words, &#8220;My lover comes
thus&#8221;&mdash;the ball is tossed in a way to illustrate the manner of the
supposed lover. The thrower terminates her sentence by a letter of the
alphabet. The one to whom the ball is thrown has to provide an
adjective beginning with the given letter as she catches the ball&mdash;thus:</p>

<p><i>Leader</i>&mdash;&#8220;My lover comes g&#8221;&mdash;(throws ball).</p>

<p><i>Catcher</i>&mdash;&#8220;Gayly&#8221;&mdash;(tosses ball back).</p>

<p><i>Leader</i>&mdash;&#8220;My lover comes h.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Catcher</i>&mdash;&#8220;Hopping.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Leader</i>&mdash;&#8220;My lover comes o.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Catcher</i>&mdash;&#8220;One-eyed.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Leader</i>&mdash;&#8220;My lover comes s.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Catcher</i>&mdash;&#8220;Smirking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Excitement is caused by the difficulty in producing a word at a
moment&#8217;s notice, and being ready to catch the ball at the same time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Telegrams</span></h3>

<p>Each player is provided with paper and pencil, upon which any
twelve letters are written, with sufficient space left between for words.</p>

<p>The leader gives a topic, such as a wedding, accident, invitation,
&amp;c. A watch is placed on the table, and from ten to fifteen minutes
given, during which each player concocts a telegram from the letters
supplied by his left-hand neighbor.</p>

<p>At a signal, the telegrams are thrust under a hat, and read out in
turn by the leader.</p>

<p><i>Example 1.</i>&mdash;Topic: a sensational robbery.</p>

<table class="telegram" summary="Game">

<tr>
<td>S.</td>
<td>B.</td>
<td>O.</td>
<td>B.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>H.</td>
<td>M.</td>
<td>J.</td>
<td>P.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>K.</td>
<td>I.</td>
<td>P.</td>
<td>H.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page480">[480]</span></p>

<p>From these letters  may be devised the  following telegram:&mdash;
&#8220;Serious burglary; one box hairpins missing.  Jane prostrate; kindly
inform police&mdash;Henry.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Example 2.</i>&mdash;Topic: a catastrophe.</p>

<table class="telegram" summary="Game">

<tr>
<td>C.</td>
<td>A.</td>
<td>S.</td>
<td>D.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>P.</td>
<td>B.</td>
<td>C.</td>
<td>A.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>B.</td>
<td>Q.</td>
<td>D.</td>
<td>W.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>&#8220;Cat ate Sunday dinner. Please bring cheese and bread; quite
distracted&mdash;Wifie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The funnier the telegram, the greater the laughter when it is read
out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Fan Fight</span></h3>

<p>The players divide into two lines. A piece of tape is stretched
across the room, and before every two players a feather is placed.
Each player possesses a Japanese fan, and the object is to lift the
feather and waft it on to a stretch of newspaper, which marks the
opponents&#8217; den.</p>

<p>The dens are guarded by goal-keepers, also armed with fans, and
their business is a lively one.</p>

<p>Feathers must not be blown, or pushed with the hand, as happens
sometimes when the excitement of the game makes one forgetful of all
else but the threatening direction the feather is taking. Only the fan
is to be used.</p>

<p>The feathers should be of different colors. When one of a side
succeeds in driving a feather into the opposite den, he and his adversary
retire from the game, but naturally they share the prevailing excitement
and watch every movement of their respective sides, cheering and
encouraging them to win.</p>

<p>When the feathers belonging to one side are all captured in a den,
the other side is conqueror.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Panama Canal</span></h3>

<p>One of the company is chosen as director, and addresses the company
in some such way as <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;It having been discovered by the director
of the Panama Canal Company that the water of the canal is often
disturbed to a dangerous degree by means of the passionate sighs and
turbulent emotions of the passengers cruising upon it, they have decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page481">[481]</span>
that a penitentiary tax shall be levied upon all ships containing lovers,
and that, for every kiss given, toll shall be exacted.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company now pass slowly before the director, who asks each
questions as to the name, destination, cargo, number and description
of passengers, and any other questions relating to vessels which may
occur to him.</p>

<p>No answer must contain the letter K, for this being the initial letter
of &#8220;kiss&#8221; is forbidden, and the person who uses it is obliged to pay
any forfeit demanded by the captain.</p>

<p>A few questions and answers might run like <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain to passing <span class="nowrap">figure&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;What have you in your ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you hail from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Liverpool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To which port are you sailing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any girls on board,&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of course, the captain&#8217;s aim is to force &#8220;the ships&#8221; to introduce the
letter K in their answers.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Longest Line</span></h3>

<p>This is a good competitive game. Men and boys should stand with
their feet on a chalked line. Each must stoop down to a half-sitting
position, and with the left hand resting on the knee and the right hand
inserted beneath the right leg, draw a line as long as possible without
rising or using the left hand.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Musical Buff</span></h3>

<p>Station a person in each corner of the apartment. Then blindfold
one of the party, and lead him to the center.</p>

<p>The master of the ceremonies points to each of the four in succession,
and each says in a clear separate tone the word &#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the word has been said by each in turn, the blind man endeavors
to find his way towards the person who spoke first.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Magic Hieroglyphics</span></h3>

<p>For this seemingly mysterious achievement a confederate is required.
He must know <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page482">[482]</span></p>

<p>Consonants are revealed by means of sentences, which the wizard
speaks in a natural and unostentatious manner.</p>

<p>The confederate is banished from the room while the party decide
upon the word he shall be called upon to guess. Monosyllables are
preferable.</p>

<p>When he returns the wizard is armed with a wand, by means of
which he proceeds to make imaginary pictures on the carpet.</p>

<p>Supposing the word to be <i>orange</i>. He begins with four taps, and
the confederate, who is all attention, knows that the word begins with
the fourth vowel, O.</p>

<p>The wizard, flourishing his wand, remarks with extreme innocence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather fatiguing work, as you perceive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The confederate says to himself R.</p>

<p>One tap is the next sound for A.</p>

<p>And some sentence such <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;No one can imagine the mental strain,&#8221; supplies the letter N to
his alert companion.</p>

<p>The wizard&#8217;s query, voiced in a mocking tone,</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting near it?&#8221; supplies the letter G.</p>

<p>A few more imaginary pictures, and two taps, which represent letter
E,  and the confederate with an air of profound relief wipes his brow
and declares confidently that the word is <i>orange</i>.</p>

<p><i>Result.</i>&mdash;The company applaud loudly, and is thoroughly mystified.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Auction Game</span></h3>

<p>This is a most fascinating resource for a wet wintry afternoon,
and its preparations are interesting enough to keep a whole houseful
of young folk occupied and amused. A large piece of cardboard is cut
into twenty-five squares, and on each is pasted a picture of some article
taken from advertisements in old newspapers, magazines, or catalogues.
The pictures are numbered, and on the back a price in keeping with the
article is written.</p>

<p>The more variety there is among the stock for sale the better. It
may contain anything from a thoroughbred Persian to a set of ninepins,
and the prices may be copied from the catalogues, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When this is done, a mint of paper or cardboard money is manufactured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page483">[483]</span>
The range of coin corresponds to the prices of the articles.
Should the most expensive of these be marked $500, the paper money
must include that amount. Upon each disc of cardboard is written its
value.</p>

<p>The guests having arrived, the capital is divided among them in
equal portions. If there has been no time to manufacture the coin,
imitation money can be purchased quite cheaply, and this lends a greater
reality to the game.</p>

<p>The first thing is to secure an auctioneer amongst the party,
who possesses a ready flow of language, and is not troubled by
shyness. An amiable uncle, or other grown-up relative, will do
capitally.</p>

<p>The auctioneer stands on a chair or stool, and cries out the article
before him, treating it as if it were real.</p>

<p>He is provided with a hammer, and the company begin an eager
bidding for the thing that takes their fancy.</p>

<p>The players, as may be expected, are as anxious as people in a real
auction to obtain what they covet at the lowest price possible.</p>

<p>Should a member offer more than he is able to pay, and succeed
in being the last to name the highest price, he pays a forfeit of ten
cents to each of the other buyers, and the article is again placed on the
auctioneer&#8217;s table.</p>

<p>The winner is the individual who has got the best value for his
money, and has the most capital in hand by the time the twenty-five
articles are sold.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to offer prizes&mdash;a good one for the discreet and
careful buyer, and a &#8220;booby&#8221; for the poor foolish spendthrift, who
has nothing to show at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Excitement and eagerness are increased by the cry of the auctioneer,
&#8220;Going, going, gone!&#8221; and the beat of his hammer.</p>

<p>If he is able to introduce funny narratives concerning the articles
into his harangue, so much the better.</p>

<p>For instance, a pair of boots, fashioned from the corpse of the
King of Prussia&#8217;s pet calf, and the black kid gloves which King Charles
II.  wore at the funeral of his great-aunt; the mouse-trap that once
held prisoner a rodent of aristocratic lineage and purple blood; the
ash-tray, into which the burnt cigar of Peter the Great is supposed to
have fallen&mdash;all should go at a high price.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Whistle</span></h3>

<p>Another excellent game is played in the following manner.</p>

<p>One of the company is blindfolded, and a long ribbon, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page484">[484]</span>
which is threaded a whistle, is pinned to his back, and he is told that
he must catch the blower and discover the whistle.</p>

<p>Of course, he has no idea that it is on his own person.</p>

<p>He is swung into the center of the room, and his playmates make
surreptitious dives at the whistle and raise it to their lips, taking care
not to stretch the ribbon so that he will feel the tug.</p>

<p>Perfect silence should be maintained by those eddying round him;
they move on tip-toe, with bated breath, but now and then sounds of
stifled laughter are heard.</p>

<p>The &#8220;blind&#8221; man seeks high and low for the possessor of the
whistle, his ears strained to catch the direction of the sound. He may
succeed in embracing a youth or damsel, but his search round her neck,
waist, or in her fingers for the missing whistle is futile.</p>

<p>It will be long ere he guesses the secret, if he ever does, and the
delight of young and old at his expense is hilarious.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Blind Brothers</span></h3>

<p>All who are unfamiliar with this mysterious game are banished from
the room and brought in separately.</p>

<p>The master of ceremonies blandly invites each to be seated on one
of two chairs placed back to back and touching each other; the other
chair is occupied by one of the initiated in the performance. A sheet
is thrown over the couple, and round them circle those of the guests
who are aware of what is to happen.</p>

<p>One of the two blind men, the confederate, is secretly armed with
a light roll of paper.</p>

<p>To the strains of the pianoforte, the other players march round.
Suddenly the individual who has been brought in feels a light tap on
his head; he should at once cry out to his <span class="nowrap">companion&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, I&#8217;m balked.&#8221;</p>

<p>The confederate immediately replies, &#8220;Who balked you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other tries vainly to guess.</p>

<p>Presently his companion bangs his own head, and wails in
<span class="nowrap">distress&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Brother, I&#8217;m balked,&#8221; and the other <span class="nowrap">replies&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who balked you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is long before the guileless brother guesses that the assault comes
from the arm of his relative lifted out of the sheet.</p>

<p>Should he fail to do so in a given time, another victim is called in
to take his place; he joins the circle moving round the chairs, and
sees for himself the manner in which the poor unsuspecting &#8220;brother&#8221;
is deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page485">[485]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Poets&#8217; Corner</span></h3>

<p>This is an excellent and ingenious pastime for young men and women
who have outgrown the old-world games of &#8220;Hunt the Slipper&#8221; and
&#8220;Hide and Seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;poets&#8221; are each given a slip of paper and pencil, at the head
of which they write any question they like. When this is written, the
papers are folded, so that the sentence is concealed, and passed on to
the left-hand neighbor, who, without looking at the question, writes
any word she likes beneath so long as it is a noun. This is again
concealed, and passed to a third party, who must compose a rhythm
or stanza, which includes both question and noun. As these have no
relation to each other, some ingenuity is needed to link the two in a
verse.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the question given is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Question</i>&mdash;What is the time?</p>

<p><i>Noun</i>&mdash;Chair.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Jack&#8217;s Going Strong</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Jack&#8221; is a piece of firewood, held in the flames until its tip
glows. It is then passed from hand to hand among the players.
Each says, as he receives the smoldering torch, &#8220;Jack&#8217;s going
strong.&#8221; The aim is to get rid of &#8220;Jack&#8221; before the spark dies. The
player, who is obliged to own that &#8220;Jack is dead,&#8221; is compelled to pay
a forfeit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack&#8221; should be a long stick, held out at arm&#8217;s length, so that,
if he falls by accident, he will not burn holes in party dresses. The
floor should be without a carpet. There is much fun and excitement
to be gleaned from this simple game, as no one wishes to have &#8220;Jack&#8217;s&#8221;
corpse on their hands.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Name Divinations</span></h3>

<p>This is a clever puzzle game, which seems to the beholder to be

<p>The manipulator shows the table to the individual whose name
he wishes to discover, asking him to point out the column or columns
that contain the initial letter. A glance at the table will show that
if it is in only one column it must be the top letter. Should
it be found to be in more than one, it is discovered by adding the
first letters of the columns in which it is stated to be, the sum supplying
the alphabetical position of the letter. For example, take the name
<i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth glances at the table and looks for the columns in which
her initial letter occurs. It is obvious that she must be careful not to
overlook its repetition. She informs you that it is to be found in
columns 1 and 3. Now, the columns mentioned are topped by the
letters A and D, which are the first and fourth letters of the alphabet.
Add these together and you get 5. <i>E is the fifth letter.</i> In case you
forget it, write it on a slip of paper. The next letter, Elizabeth informs
you, occurs in columns 3 and 4. These are headed by D and H =
4 + 8 = 12. <i>The twelfth letter is L.</i> Columns 1 and 4 contain I, headed
by A and H = 1 + 8 = 9. <i>The ninth letter is I.</i> Z is found in columns
2 and 4 and 5, headed by B, H and P = 2 + 8 + 16 = 26. <i>The twenty-sixth
letter is Z.</i> The next letter exists only in column No. 1, therefore
it is A. The next letter exists only in column No. 2, therefore
it is B. The next letter exists only in columns 1 and 3. The top letters
of these, A and D = 1 + 4 = 5. <i>The fifth letter is E.</i></p>

<p>T is found in columns 3 and 5. Top letters D and P = 4 + 16 = 20.
The twentieth letter is T.</p>

<p>H occurs in column 4, therefore it is the top letter, H.</p>

<p>Result&mdash;Elizabeth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wizard Photography</span></h3>

<p>The wizard, who possesses a confederate, is banished from the
room. During his absence the latter produces a piece of paper, and
declares his intention of taking a photograph of any individual among
the company upon it, in such a manner that it shall be visible to the
wizard alone, who, upon examining it closely, will call out the name of
the original.</p>

<p>Naturally every one considers that this must be quite an impossible
proceeding, and for that reason every one becomes very curious and
watchful, making up his mind to discover the trick.</p>

<p>The confederate fixes upon one of the company, poses her to his
satisfaction, tells her not to look grave, &amp;c., just as professional photographers
do, and when she is quite ready and gazing at the sheet of
paper, which is held out in the manipulator&#8217;s left hand, he passes his<span class="pagenum" id="Page488">[488]</span>
right over it, snaps his fingers, and tells her that the wonder is
accomplished.</p>

<p>He hastens to wrap the &#8220;plate&#8221; in his handkerchief, and, calling
in the wizard, hands it to him, retiring to a seat where the latter can
observe him without appearing to do so. The wizard, looking very
mysterious and wise, bids the company maintain an unbroken silence,
while he unwraps and examines the &#8220;plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>His confederate, meanwhile, imitates as nearly as possible the position
of the original of the photograph.</p>

<p>Should she cross her feet, toss back her hair, rest her chin on her
hand, or perform any other trivial action, the confederate does the same,
quite naturally so as not to rouse any suspicion or notice. All attention
being concentrated on the wizard, his actions will not be observed by
any one save the manipulator, who is led by the position he assumes
to guess the individual whose likeness on the &#8220;plate&#8221; is supposed to
be visible to him alone.</p>

<p>Few would realize, until they try the game, the wonder and admiration
of the guests, for the wizard who successfully achieves his purpose,
and the means employed, are seldom, if ever, discovered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Missing Ring</span></h3>

<p>A plain curtain ring is threaded through a piece of tape or ribbon,
knotted at the ends. The guests form a circle round a central figure.
The ring is passed swiftly along through hands gripping the tape, while
the master of ceremonies counts one, two.</p>

<p>At three, all fists must be threaded by the tape and perfectly
motionless, and the man in the center, who is permitted to observe
the circuit of the ring, is called upon to say which person has possession
of it. Should he guess rightly, he changes places with the
individual.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Apples and Nuts</span></h3>

<p>Mix a number of hazel nuts and apples together on a table removed
from the wall; hand a teaspoon and table knife to each of the guests.
Bid them, at a given signal, move to the table, with the knife in the
right hand, the spoon in the left, and scoop up one apple and one nut.
This is no easy matter on a smooth surface, for the probability is that
the fruit and nuts will roll to the floor.</p>

<p>When they are secured they must be conveyed to a dish at the
other end of the room. He who performs this feat successfully the
most times wins, and the apples and nuts are awarded him as a prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page489">[489]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Amiable Dog</span></h3>

<p>The party is divided into two lines. The first player begins by
saying, &#8220;Our little dog is amiable.&#8221; The first player on the opposite
side must answer quickly with another adjective beginning with the
same letter thus, &#8220;Our little dog is artful.&#8221; Meanwhile, the first player
counts ten. If in that time his opponent fails to respond he is obliged
to go over to the opposite rank. Other letters of the alphabet may be
used. The side that gains all the &#8220;men&#8221; wins.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LX</b><br />
PARLOR TRICKS AND PUZZLES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tangrams</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the oldest and most fascinating puzzles comes, like so many
quaint things, from the Far East where, over four thousand years ago,
a learned Chinaman named Tan made the invention which forty centuries
have been unable to improve or alter. Worthy of a civilization
that invented Chess, Tan&#8217;s puzzle has lived on unchanged through the
ages, affording amusement and thought to men of such ability as Napoleon,
who, during his exile on St. Helena, used to spend hour after
hour with the little black geometric figures.</p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>Take a perfect square of stiff cardboard of any size, say five inches,
and see that the angles and sides are true. Now, very carefully mark
it off according to the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig60_1">Fig. 1</a>, which may be explained
thus. ABCD is the square. Rule a line from B to C, and mark off
M and H halfway between B and D and C and D respectively, and
join M and H. Find G the midpoint of MH and join AG. Mark
K and F, midpoints of CE and EB respectively, and join KH and FG.
Having thus marked out the card, take a very sharp knife and cut the
cardboard along the dotted line. You will then have the seven pieces
as shown in <a href="#Fig60_2">Fig. 2</a>, which are numbered for convenience
sake. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page491">[491]</span>
colored these pieces dead black with India ink on both sides, you are
ready to start the great Tangram Puzzle.</p>

and <a href="#Fig60_4A">4<i>a</i></a>, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page492">[492]</span>
another example of how the pieces are to be put together; similarly

who is holding her skirts up so high as she crosses the street. <a href="#Fig60_6">Figs.
6<i>b</i></a> and <a href="#Fig60_6C">6<i>c</i></a> show a gentleman apparently tired of life.</p>

<p>These seven pieces can be so disposed as to make hundreds of figures,
giving scope for boundless ingenuity and skill.</p>

<p>A good winter evening competition can be arranged by making
several sets of Tangram pieces, and distributing one set to each member
of the party. The name of some familiar object should then be announced
(for example&mdash;horse&mdash;cat&mdash;washerwoman), two minutes being
allowed for construction, and points given to the best Tangram.</p>

<p>A variation can be introduced by taking a well-known nursery rhyme
or fairy tale, and asking each person to make a Tangram to represent
a different subject in the tale. Supposing &#8220;The Farmer&#8217;s Boy&#8221; to
be the rhyme, one person would make the figure of that youth, to another
would fall the horse, to a third the dog, and so on. As in the former
case a prize might be awarded to the most successful manipulator of
the little black pieces.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Scissor Trick</span></h3>

<p>Ask one of the ladies, who naturally knows all about scissors, to
do the following trick. Holding the hands with palms upward, hang
a pair of scissors on the little fingers, as shown in <a href="#Fig60_7">Fig. 7</a>. The fingers
should then be slightly bent so that the scissors stick upright as in
<a href="#Fig60_8">Fig. 8</a>; next ask her to turn the hands round rapidly back to back
when the scissors will make a complete revolution,
and should finally point upward again. But it
is just at this point that the trick comes in, for
the fair lady will find that instead of the scissors
pointing up to the ceiling, they are directed down
to the floor! (<a href="#Fig60_9">Fig. 9</a>.)</p>

<div class="split5050">

after complete
revolution.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>This is the occasion for you to show how really
clever you are, and by bearing the following hints
in mind it will prove a very easy matter.</p>

<p>When the hands are in the position of <a href="#Fig60_8">Fig. 8</a>,
take care that the rings of the scissors are passed
over the last joints of the little fingers only, so
that a complete revolution can take place between the palms of the
hands and the fingers themselves. To bring the scissors upright will
then follow in the natural course of events.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Blowing through a Bottle</span></h3>

<p>Can you blow hard enough to make your breath pass right through
a thick glass bottle? The majority of people will say &#8220;No,&#8221; and dare
you to perform the task. It is really very easy.</p>

<p>Take a large round bottle or jam jar, and place a lighted candle<span class="pagenum" id="Page495">[495]</span>
behind it, as in <a href="#Fig60_10">Fig. 10</a>. Now stand so that the bottle or jar is interposed
between yourself and the
light, and blow. The flame will
be extinguished at once!</p>

<p>There is scarcely need to tell
your surprised friends that the
shape of the bottle has really
caused your breath to follow the
curve of the two sides, unite at
the back, and blow out the light.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Safe Bet</span></h3>

<p>Lay a dime, or a dollar
if you feel so inclined, upon
the palm of your hand, and promise to give it to whoever can brush
it off with an ordinary clothes
brush, as shown in <a href="#Fig60_11">Fig. 11</a>.
The only condition you need make
is that they shall brush towards
the tips of the fingers and not to
one side.</p>

<p>You need have no fear of the
result, and can feel quite assured
that your money is as safe as if it
were in your own pocket. Whatever
the explanation may be, the
fact remains that no amount of
brushing will move the coin the
hundredth part of an inch on your open palm.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;The position of coin in palm.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Do not touch the Coin</span></h3>

<p>Place a dime upon a polished
table and ask one of
your friends to pick it up without
touching either the coin or
the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig60_12">

<img src="images/illo495c.png" alt="" width="500" height="208" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;Showing how coin is removed from
table.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>A glance at <a href="#Fig60_12">Fig. 12</a> shows
how the trick is done. Slightly
curve your hand so that it
almost touches the table, and
blow steadily upon the table at a distance of about five or six inches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page496">[496]</span>
The force of your breath passing beneath the coin will carry it into
your hand.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quis Separabit?</span></h3>

<p>If there happen to be a newly-married couple amongst your friends,
the following little trick may cause them a blush of happiness.</p>

<p>Get them to fold their hands, as shown in <a href="#Fig60_13">Fig. 13</a>, in such a way
that the wedding-ring finger of the left hand, and the corresponding
finger of the right hand, are doubled inwards as far as the second joint,
and the knuckles of those joints press firmly against each other.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<p>Now, tell them to separate their two thumbs, as in <a href="#Fig60_14">Fig. 14</a>, while
you say, &#8220;Parents and children may be separated!&#8221;
Then let them do the same with the two forefingers,
remarking, &#8220;Brothers and sisters may be separated!&#8221;
The same performance may be repeated with the two
little fingers, and you remark, &#8220;Even lovers may be
separated!&#8221; Finally, let them try to separate the
two middle fingers, when they will find they cannot
get them apart. Whereupon you state emphatically,
&#8220;But husband and wife can never be divided!&#8221;</p>

drawn through
arm to electrify it.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Stick no Bills</span></h3>

<p>Take a piece of coarse brown paper, the coarser
the better, and warm it steadily before the fire. Now
draw it rapidly a dozen times between your arm and
your body, as in <a href="#Fig60_15">Fig. 15</a>, so that it receives a good
friction upon each side. Now press the paper against the wall, and
you will find that it remains as firmly stuck as though a whole pot of
the best paste had been used for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page497">[497]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Mighty Voice</span></h3>

<p>A prophet is never without honor but in his own country, and
few of your acquaintances will believe you to be such a wonderful
person that with a single shout you can break a glass. Yet it is very
easy to convince them.</p>

<p>Take an ordinary wine-glass, and hold it by its foot firmly to the
table. Make the glass ring with a touch of the finger (it will probably
sound a rather low note). While the glass is yet tingling, raise it
rapidly to your mouth, and shout the same note that it rang full into
the bowl with all your force. The chances are ten to one that the
glass will shiver to pieces.</p>

<p>The reason of this phenomenon is the vibrations caused by the
tingling are so suddenly increased by the strength of your voice that
the glass is unable to bear the strain, and therefore breaks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Genuine Match</span></h3>

<p>It is surprising how universal is the law of love! Even two plain
pieces of wood are unable to resist the impulses of the great passion.</p>

<p>Take out the bottom of a match-box, and split it into two pieces.
Double over the ends at about a quarter of the way up, as in <a href="#Fig60_16">Fig. 16</a>.
On one piece make the rough sketch of a girl, and upon the other a
similar drawing of a man, and then place the pieces together, as shown
in the illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig60_16">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;Drawings in position.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>If you pour a few drops of water over the joints of the two pieces
of wood, you will find that the two figures slowly and surely rise up to
meet each other, and will eventually press their two faces closely in a
long kiss. They may be some time about it, but then pleasures delayed
are always doubly enjoyable!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page498">[498]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dying Fish</span></h3>

<p>Cut a piece of deal into a prism about four inches long, and color
two of the sides black or dark blue,
painting the remaining side white.
Sharpen one end into a small triangular
point, and paint two eyes and
a mouth thereon, so that the completed
figure appears as in <a href="#Fig60_17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you put this in a basin
of water very heavily salted, you will find that the fish floats quite
naturally, as in <a href="#Fig60_18">Fig. 18</a>, whilst if you place him in a basin of plain
fresh water, he will immediately turn on his back and float dead, with
the white side uppermost, as in <a href="#Fig60_18">Fig. 18<i>a</i></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New-laid Eggs</span></h3>

<p>Here is a very handy method of discovering whether
an egg is fresh or not.</p>

<p>Pass an elastic band around the egg, and hang it upon
a wire, as shown in <a href="#Fig60_19">Fig. 19</a>. Twist the egg and band
round several times, and then release it, when the band
will rapidly untwist with the egg. If the latter be quite
fresh, it will stop almost immediately, but if it happens
to be rather older than is desirable, it will twist and untwist,
reversing several times before it finally comes to
rest. This applies to eggs which have been boiled&mdash;indeed to
any egg that is &#8220;set.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Will-power Test</span></h3>

<p>This is scarcely a trick, as it really serves to prove which of two
persons has the stronger will-power.</p>

<p>Place a door-key between the pages in the middle of a book in
such a way that the handle projects an inch or two, as in <a href="#Fig60_20">Fig. 20</a>.
Pass a piece of string
round the book, and
draw into a tight knot,
so that the key is held
firmly in its place.</p>

<p>Now, let the persons
who desire to test
the strength of their
wills support the book
by the ring of the key
resting on their extended
forefingers, as
in the <a href="#Fig60_20">illustration</a>. If
one person wills the
book to turn from
right to left, and the
other wills it to turn in the opposite direction, it will be found that
the book obeys whichever party is possessed of the stronger will.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20.&mdash;A will-power trick.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>There is yet another way of testing this strange example of
personal magnetism.</p>

<p>Let one of the parties (preferably he of the stronger will) think of
some name, Mary, for instance. Informing nobody else of the name
he has chosen, let him repeat the alphabet very slowly, when it will be
found that, as he arrives at the first letter, M, the book will give a slight
turn, and will behave in a similar way for all the other letters of the
name. If both parties know the name, the book will turn much more
readily, as a result of the united forces of their wills.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Repeater</span></h3>

<p>This is an interesting example of some strange agency at work
amongst us.</p>

<p>Make a running noose at the end of a piece of fine thread, and
pass it securely round a quarter, as shown in <a href="#Fig60_21">Fig. 21</a>. Taking care
that the thread passes over the tip of the thumb, support the thread
from your hand, in the manner shown in the illustration, in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page500">[500]</span>
way that the quarter is hanging within a wine-glass or tumbler. Take
care also to keep the hand perfectly steady, and await results.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the quarter will
oscillate, but it will soon become quite
still. Then, actuated by no motion of
your hand, it will begin to swing to and
fro like a pendulum, and will finally strike
one of the sides of the glass.</p>

<p>Counting the number of times it thus
makes the glass ring, you will find that
the number corresponds exactly with the
nearest hour to the time of day. For
instance, at 11:20 there would be eleven
rings, whilst at a quarter to twelve there
would be twelve.</p>

<p>The cause of this phenomenon can be
left to scientists to decide.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">The Obliging Banana</span></h3>

<p>It is rare that one can get a fruit so
obliging as to peel itself, but upon certain
occasions a banana will put itself out of the way to
render this favor.</p>

<p>Cut off one end of a banana, and with a knife
just start ripping up the skin on the four sides in
the usual manner.</p>

<p>Now take an empty bottle, put some methylated
spirit inside, and drop a lighted match to ignite
the spirits. As soon as the flame has died out,
place the prepared end of the banana in the mouth
of the bottle, and you will find that the banana is
slowly drawn inside, peeling off its skin as the fruit
disappears (<a href="#Fig60_22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<p>The reason for this condescension on the part
of the banana is simple. As soon as the bottle
begins to cool from the heat of the flames, the air
is contracted inside, a vacuum is caused, and the
fruit is sucked into the bottle.</p>

<p>The same trick can be performed with a water bottle and a
shelled hard-boiled egg.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Smoker&#8217;s Fancy</span></h3>

<p>Although most ardent smokers will admit there is little pleasure
in smoking in the dark, there are few who will not be surprised at
the following trick.</p>

<p>Induce a cigarette devotee to have his eyes bandaged, and make
him moisten the ends of two cigarettes. Having lighted one of them,
allow the victim to have a few whiffs and then take it out of his mouth
and replace it by the unlighted cigarette. Continue changing the
cigarettes in this manner for a few minutes, and you will presently
find that he is quite unable to tell which he has in his mouth, and is
quite at a loss to know whether he is puffing away at the lighted
&#8220;cig.&#8221; or not.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 23.&mdash;The mysterious

stage.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">The Mysterious Bands</span></h3>

<p>Take a full sheet of a large newspaper, <i>e.g.</i> the first and last pages
(which make one sheet) of a paper like the <i>New York Times</i>, and cut
three straight strips (a, b, c) about three inches wide,
as shown in <a href="#Fig60_23">Fig. 23</a>. Now join the ends of these
strips in the following manner in order to make three
loops.</p>

<p>In the strip a bend round D, and paste it on to
the under side of E.</p>

<p>Make a loop of b in a similar manner, but giving
the strip a half turn, and pasting the under side of F
to the under side of G.</p>

<p>In the third strip this twist is replaced by a full
turn of the paper, so that H is pasted on the under
side of N, as in the first instance.</p>

<p>When making these bands it will be quite easy
to conceal from the spectators the twists you have given to the paper;
and, indeed, the success of the trick depends upon this part of your
preparation not being observed.</p>

<p>Now comes the exhibition of the trick. Cut each of the loops into<span class="pagenum" id="Page502">[502]</span>
two, in the direction of the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig60_24">Fig. 24</a>, when the following
astonishing result will be obtained.</p>

<p>The band a will be cut into two equal loops, as in <a href="#Fig60_24A">Fig. 24<i>a</i></a>, the loop
b will turn into one large loop twice the size of the original as in
<a href="#Fig60_24B">Fig. 24<i>b</i></a>, whilst the loop C will be transformed into two links of a
chain, as in <a href="#Fig60_24C">Fig. 24<i>c</i></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Tricky String Puzzle</span></h3>

of a friend, as in <a href="#Fig60_27">Fig. 27</a>. The

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 29.&mdash;Showing mode of freeing key from string.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>To understand the diagrams
it will be necessary to remember
the following explanations of the
letters used in <a href="#Fig60_28">Fig. 28</a>.</p>

<p>A and B are the hands of
the person just described whose
thumbs bear the string.</p>

<p>C and D are your own hands,
left and right respectively.</p>

<p>E is the hand of a third person who holds the key.</p>

<p>F and G are the
two sides of the loop.</p>

<p>Begin by catching
the string F on your
little finger of C and
G on the little finger
of D, as in <a href="#Fig60_28">Fig. 28</a>.
Now transfer the string
from the little finger
of C to the thumb of
B, and thus free your
hand C.</p>

<p>Between the forefinger
and thumb of
B you must take the
string G between the
key and A.</p>

<p>Now catch this part you have taken round the thumb of B, slip<span class="pagenum" id="Page504">[504]</span>
the string from the little finger of D, and when E pulls the key, it will
come quite free from the
string (<a href="#Fig60_29">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Sure Eye</span></h3>

<p>Stick a sharply-pointed
knife, preferably with a
heavy handle, into the
lintel of the door, or into
a wooden beam upon the
ceiling. Then ask for
some one with a sure eye
to mark the exact spot
on the floor by putting
a cent upon it, where the knife will drop when displaced.</p>

<p>This is easily done in the following manner. Take care that the
knife is very lightly stuck into the wood, so that it will fall at the
slightest touch.</p>

<p>Fill a glass with water, and raising it to the knife immerse the
handle to the height of an inch or so. Then watch where the drop
of water, which will fall when you remove the glass, strikes the ground,
place the cent upon the spot, and you will find that the knife will
fall upon that identical place.</p>

<h3>&#8220;<span class="smcap">That is the Man</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>Fold a piece of paper into four, and cut a pointer out of it, as
shown in <a href="#Fig60_30">Fig. 30</a>. Now run a needle through a cork and balance the
pointer on its tip, as shown. Place an inverted tumbler over the whole
contrivance (<a href="#Fig60_30">Fig. 30<i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page505">[505]</span></p>

<p>By rubbing the outside of the tumbler with a piece of rag, or even
a handkerchief, you can make the pointer turn in whatever direction
you desire, as it will swing round to whatever portion of the glass you
happen to rub.</p>

<p>Announce that you will make it point to Mr. Jones. If you
then rub the glass on the side nearest to that gentleman, the paper
needle will swing round and point directly to him.</p>

<p>By rubbing the handkerchief rapidly round and round the glass
the needle will be made to revolve with considerable speed, to the
great delight of the younger members of the party.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Needle-Threading Extraordinary</span></h3>

<p>Thread a No. 6 needle with a couple of yards of fairly coarse
cotton or thread, and draw them through until the two ends are of
equal length.</p>

<p>Now pass the point of the needle right through the two strands,
as in <a href="#Fig60_31">Fig. 31</a>, and continue pulling the needle as in <a href="#Fig60_31">Fig. 31<i>a</i></a> until the
threads have passed through each other and appear a continuous piece,
as in <a href="#Fig60_31">Fig. 31<i>b</i></a>. This should have been done before showing the trick
to the company. As there will be no knot, it is highly improbable
that any one will notice a peculiarity in the thread.</p>

<p>You then state that, without looking at the needle, you will thread
it with as many strands of cotton as it will hold. Proceed in the
following way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page506">[506]</span></p>

<p>Holding the needle with the point upwards beneath the table, out
of sight of yourself and the others, catch one of the threads at a point

<p>By doing this the invisible knot is passed through the eye, carrying
with it two strands, and by continuing this action the knot is
passed several times, until eventually a result similar to that shown in
<a href="#Fig60_33">Fig. 33</a> appears.</p>

<p>Drawing the knot to the bottom of this series of loops, you can
then cut off all the ends as well as the knot, and present the threaded
needle to your friends as it appears in <a href="#Fig60_33">Fig. 33<i>a</i></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Magician&#8217;s Bite</span></h3>

<p>Take an ordinary piece of string or thread, and offer to cut it in
two if somebody present will guarantee to join it into one piece again
without any knot. You

time that by wizardry you
are able yourself to do this
by a simple bite of the
teeth.</p>

<p>This trick can only be done on a sunny day, for a reason which
will be very evident to
those who try it.</p>

<p>Obtain a clear glass
bottle, in the cork of which
stick a hooked pin. By
means of a piece of thread
hang a small weight from
this pin within the bottle,
as in <a href="#Fig60_37">Fig. 37</a>, and then request
some one to cut the
cord without drawing the
cork.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 37.&mdash;Sun&#8217;s rays focused on weighted
thread.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>All that is necessary to
do this is a magnifying
glass which is placed between
the bottle and the
sun at the right distance to focus the rays of the latter upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page508">[508]</span>
cord. In a few seconds the heat of the converging rays will burn
through the thread, and the weight will fall to the bottom of the
bottle. In the same way you can</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Light a Cigarette Without Matches</span></h3>

<p>Concentrate the rays of the sun upon the end of the cigarette, and
draw in the ordinary way (if you are old enough to smoke), when the
cigarette will rapidly be ignited.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Another String Trick</span></h3>

<p>Stick a penknife into a post or tree, or other strong upright of
wood, and pass a piece of string behind the post and above the knife,
as in <a href="#Fig60_38">Fig. 38</a>. Bring the end C round the post and pass B over it.
Bring C round again and cross it over the knife, and B round the
knife over C, as in <a href="#Fig60_38">Fig. 38<i>a</i></a>. Pass the ends round the post again,
always remembering that B must be over C, and then tie the two ends
in a knot, as in <a href="#Fig60_39">Fig. 39</a>.</p>

<p>By removing the knife from the post, you will now find that the
whole loop comes away intact, having never really been passed round
the post at all.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Try This!</span></h3>

<p>A candle can be lighted without approaching the match to the
wick in this way.</p>

<p>Light a candle in the ordinary manner, and take care that the wick<span class="pagenum" id="Page509">[509]</span>
is fairly long and burns brightly. Blow it out suddenly, and by
applying a lighted match to the smoke at the height of an inch or two,
the candle will instantly relight without your having to put the match
to the wick.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Steady Hand</span></h3>

<p>If any of your friends boast of a steady hand, you can easily give
their pride a fall by wagering that not one of them can move a glass
of water from one table to another without
spilling every drop it contains.</p>

<p>Fill a tumbler with water to the
very brim. Place a piece of perfectly
flat, stout paper on the top of it, as
shown in <a href="#Fig60_40">Fig. 40</a>, and the palm of the
hand on the top of that. Now turn
the glass upside down very quickly and
carefully, and place it upon a flat part
of the table, having done which slide
the piece of paper from beneath it. As
the air cannot enter none of the water escapes, but it will be absolutely
impossible to move the glass without spilling the water.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LXI</b><br />
&#8220;HOW WOULD YOU&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Puzzles That Please</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">History</span> records that the blind poet Homer lost his reason in a vain
endeavor to solve a riddle, and from his days until these present times
much care and thought have been
expended in the invention of puzzles
both difficult and simple. It is the
object of this chapter to present the
reader with a few simple ones.</p>

<p>Two easy and yet fascinating
puzzles can be worked with an ordinary
checker-board.</p>

<h4>1. <span class="smcap">The Traveling Checker</span></h4>

<p>Place a checker upon a square
near the center of the board, as in
<a href="#Fig61_1">Fig. 1</a>. In how few moves can you
make it traverse every square in the board and return to its starting-point?</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig61_1">

<img src="images/illo510a.png" alt="" width="350" height="350" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;The traveling checker.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig61_2">

<img src="images/illo510b.png" alt="" width="250" height="152" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Joining the rings.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h4>2. <span class="smcap">Another Checker Puzzle</span></h4>

<p>Place sixteen men on a checker-board in such a manner that no
three men shall be in a line, either horizontally
or perpendicularly.</p>

<h4>3. <span class="smcap">Joining the Rings</span></h4>

<p>Nine rings are connected by six straight lines,
as shown in <a href="#Fig61_2">Fig. 2</a>. Connect these same nine
rings by four straight lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page511">[511]</span></p>

<h4>4. <span class="smcap">The Ten Rows</span></h4>

<p>This is a puzzle with nine checkers or counters. Dispose these
counters in such a manner that ten rows are
formed with three men in each row.</p>

<div class="figright w250" id="Fig61_3">

<img src="images/illo511a.png" alt="" width="250" height="241" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;The cabalistic sign.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h4>5. <span class="smcap">The Cabalistic Sign</span></h4>

<p><a href="#Fig61_3">Fig. 3</a> shows a piece of paper cut into a
famous cabalistic sign. How can you divide
it into four pieces which, placed together, shall
form a square?</p>

<h4>6. <span class="smcap">The Dangerous Anarchists</span></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there were eight anarchists confined in separate
cells connected by the system of passages shown in <a href="#Fig61_4">Fig. 4</a>. The
prisoners, each of whom had his own number, occupied cells in the
order shown.</p>

<p>One day the governor of the jail decided that his prisoners should
be transferred from one cell to another in order that their numbers
should run consecutively from left to right. Accordingly he gave
orders for this to be done, but at the same time directed his warders
that on no account were any two prisoners to meet, either in the
passages or cells. As there was only one vacant cell at their disposal,
how did the warders work this maneuver successfully?</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig61_4">

<img src="images/illo511b.png" alt="" width="600" height="162" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;The dangerous anarchists.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>You will find the best way to solve this problem is to draw a plan
similar to that shown in <a href="#Fig61_4">Fig. 4</a>, and place eight numbered counters in
the respective cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page512">[512]</span></p>

<h4>7. <span class="smcap">Catching the Donkey</span></h4>

<p>A man once wanted to saddle a donkey, and proceeded, bridle in
hand, to the field where Ned was feeding.</p>

<p>Let <a href="#Fig61_5">Fig. 5</a> represent the field, which the man entered by the gate
at 63, whilst the ass
was standing in the
opposite corner at 2.</p>

<p>Now you can move
either the man or the
donkey to any number
in the straight
line, but neither must
cross or rest upon a
line covered by the
other. For instance,
if the donkey be at 2,
the man can move to
62, 61, 59, 36, or 13;
but he cannot go to
either 60 or to 5, for
then the donkey would
gallop up and let fly
with his heels. Ned,
on the other hand, can
go to 6, 28, 51, 3, or
4, but if he were to go to 60 or 5 the man at 63 would catch him at
once.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig61_5">

<img src="images/illo512a.png" alt="" width="450" height="452" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Catching the donkey.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Giving the donkey the first move, how soon can you place the man
in such a position that the ass is cornered and cannot escape being
bridled?</p>

<h4>8. <span class="smcap">Like to Like</span></h4>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig61_6">

<img src="images/illo512b.png" alt="" width="500" height="83" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;&#8220;Like to like.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Four black and four white counters are placed alternately in a row
of ten divisions, shown in <a href="#Fig61_6">Fig. 6</a>. By moving two at a time, how can
you arrange all the blacks and all the whites together in four moves?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page513">[513]</span></p>

<h4>9. <span class="smcap">The Broken Chain</span></h4>

<p>A lady once took to a jeweler a gold chain, broken into five pieces
of three links each (<a href="#Fig61_7">Fig. 7</a>). She asked him to repair the chain, agreeing
to pay 25 cents for each
link that he had to break and
weld in order to restore
the chain to its original
length.</p>

<p>The following day she
sent her maid for the chain
with 75 cents. If you had
been the jeweler, how would
you have mended this chain of five pieces by breaking only three links?</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig61_7">

<img src="images/illo513a.png" alt="" width="450" height="201" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;The broken chain.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h4>10. <span class="smcap">The Diamond Cross</span></h4>

<p>The same lady wished to have a diamond cross reset, and pleased
with the intelligence shown by the jeweler, she decided to give him
the work.</p>

<div class="figright w150" id="Fig61_8">

<img src="images/illo513b.png" alt="" width="125" height="218" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The diamond
cross.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>But she was determined to give him no opportunity of cheating
her, so she counted the stones from top to bottom
(<a href="#Fig61_8">Fig. 8</a>), and found there were nine. She then
counted them from the bottom to the extremity of
each arm of the cross, and found that they also
numbered nine. Having noted these figures, she sent
the cross to be reset.</p>

<p>But the jeweler was a crafty man, and knowing
how she had reckoned the diamonds, he stole two,
and having reset the remainder, he returned the
finished piece of work.</p>

<p>When she received her cross, the lady thought
it looked rather different, and counted the stones
according to her former plan. The numbers were
exact! So she paid the jeweler, who went off smiling.</p>

<p>How had he managed the theft?</p>

<h4>11. <span class="smcap">The Quarrelsome Railways</span></h4>

<p>Five competing railway companies decided to place termini in a
certain small town. But land was dear; and after much negotiation
they were able to secure sites only as shown in <a href="#Fig61_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page514">[514]</span></p>

<p>But none of the companies would grant any of its competitors
running powers over its lines, and as the municipal authorities decided
that all five lines should enter the city side
by side, the engineers found themselves confronted
with the following problem:&mdash;How
is each line to reach its destination, without
crossing any of its competitor&#8217;s tracks?</p>

<p>How would you extricate them from this
dilemma?</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;The quarrelsome
railways.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h4>12. <span class="smcap">Another Railway Problem</span></h4>

<p>This problem is shown in <a href="#Fig61_10">Fig. 10</a>. In
the railway A, B, C there are two sidings,
A, D and C, E; which meet at F. At this
latter place there is only sufficient space to contain one car of the
size of G or H, and there is no room for the engine, I. Consequently,
if this engine is sent up either of the
sidings it must return by the same tracks.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;The second railway problem.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The point to be discovered is: How can
the engine, I, transpose the two cars G and
H, by simply using the rails shown in the illustration?</p>

<h4>13. <span class="smcap">The Miter</span></h4>

<p>Study <a href="#Fig61_11">Fig. 11</a> closely, and think how you
can divide a piece of paper thus shaped
into four similar parts.</p>

<h4>6. <i>The Dangerous Anarchists</i></h4>

<p>The simplest method of rearranging the prisoners was as follows
(as there was only one vacant cell at any time the numbers designate
which prisoner was moved therein)&mdash;1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3,
1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6.</p>

<h4>7. <i>Catching the Donkey</i></h4>

<p>According to the rules of the game, the donkey moves first, and
the following is one of the shortest methods by which the man can
catch him. It will doubtless amuse you to find other, and probably
quicker ways of cornering Ned.</p>

<p>When the man has driven the ass into the corner at 5, of course
there is no more chance of escape, and Ned has to submit to the bridle

<h4>9. <i>The Broken Chain</i></h4>

<p>To repair the chain the jeweler had recourse to a very simple
device. Breaking the three links of one of the pieces he used them to
join the remaining four pieces, thus restoring it to the original length.</p>

<h4>10. <i>The Diamond Cross</i></h4>

<p>The owner of the diamond cross thought she had been very
clever in counting the stones as she did, but her cunning overreached
itself, for the jeweler had only to remove the diamonds of the extremities
of the cross-piece, and shift this latter up one point, as in <a href="#Fig61_18">Fig. 18</a>,
to make his theft almost unnoticeable. You will find the diamonds
count nine, even though two stones have been removed.</p>

<h4>11. <i>The Quarrelsome Railways</i></h4>

<p>After much surveying and discussion, the railways laid their lines
as shown in <a href="#Fig61_19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<h4>12. <i>The Other Railway Problem</i></h4>

<p>The following is the simplest method by which the engine could
transpose the cars G, H.</p>

<p>I pushes G into F, and returns and pushes H up to G. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page518">[518]</span>
cars are then coupled together, drawn down to C and pushed over
to A. G is then uncoupled, and I takes H back to F and leaves it
there. I then returns to G, pulls it back to E and leaves it there. I

<h2><b>CHAPTER LXII</b><br />
SOME OPTICAL ILLUSIONS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">When Seeing Eyes are Blind</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">But</span>, I tell you, I saw it; surely I can trust my own eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>How often have we heard this uttered as a conclusive proof of
some friend&#8217;s statement!</p>

<p>And really at first it would seem to be an assertion admitting of no
further question, were it not for the fact that we know our eyes are no
more infallible than anything else in this world, and are quite as liable
to make mistakes as are our memories.</p>

<p>It is true that eyes are good and faithful servants, fit to be trusted
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, but like all good and faithful
servants there is that hundredth case when their judgment goes
wandering, and when they leap to rash conclusions, carried away
by deceptive appearances.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, upon certain occasions, the best eyes are
actually blind! If you shut one eye and hold the page with <a href="#Fig62_1">Fig. 1</a>
at arm&#8217;s length, you will be
able to see both the spots A
and B. Now look steadily at
A, and you will still see B
quite plainly, but if you gradually
draw the book nearer to your eye, a certain point will be
reached when B becomes invisible, although if you continue to make
the book approach your face B will spring into view once more.
In other words, at the moment when you could no longer see B
your blind spot had been directed towards it, and of course saw
nothing.</p>

<img src="images/illo520a.png" alt="" width="300" height="241" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Section of the eye.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>No doubt you would like to know where this blind spot is, and
why our eyes should possess such a thing. <a href="#Fig62_2">Fig. 2</a> shows the section
of an eye which can be explained in very simple terms. The thick
black line A is a sheet of nerves which entirely envelops three-quarters
of the eye, and meeting in a point at E passes upwards into
the brain, where it records what the eye has seen. The light enters<span class="pagenum" id="Page520">[520]</span>
between the points C C, the iris, and striking through the lens B
throws all objects within the scope of vision upon what is called the
retina or screen, D. Now this screen is
furnished with millions of little nerves, each
one of which records on the large nerve A
whatever is thrown upon it, and all these
records are gathered together by A and
passed up to the brain.</p>

<p>But at the spot E, where these big
nerves are collected together, the retina,
as you notice, is pointed, and gives no
record of what is thrown upon it. So,
you see, when any object happens to come
into such a position with the eye that its image is cast upon the
point E of the retina, we have no record sent to the brain&mdash;in other
words, we cannot see it.</p>

<p>But the eye is not only blind in one point; it is very apt to be
deceived by appearances, and to make all kinds of mistakes in consequence.
Take <a href="#Fig62_3">Fig. 3</a> for instance. Would you not say that B D is
shorter than A C? Yet if you measure them you will find they are
the same length. Or in <a href="#Fig62_4">Fig. 4</a>, A B is surely longer than C D. They
are identical. Or take <a href="#Fig62_5">Fig. 5</a>, A is clearly farther from B than C
is from B, and yet A B and B C are of the same length.</p>

<img src="images/illo520b.png" alt="" width="500" height="249" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Is A C longer than B D?</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The truth is that your eye is so confused by these different lines
that it is wholly unable to form any clear estimate of how great the
distances really are. This is shown even more clearly in <a href="#Fig62_6">Fig. 6</a>
(technically known as Zollner&#8217;s lines), where you see A B and C D,
which have every appearance of being about to meet shortly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page521">[521]</span>
the direction of A C. Now if you will measure the distances between
B D and A C you will find that the lines are exactly parallel, but the
eye has been so deceived by the little cross lines running in different
directions, that it seems incredible the two thick lines are not inclined
towards one another at quite a considerable angle.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hills that Don&#8217;t Rise</span></h3>

<p>Should it ever happen that you go cycling in France, you will find
this deception practiced upon your
eyes all day long. The roads in
that country are very straight, and
are bordered upon either side by
tall trees, so that from wherever
you stand a long avenue stretches
before you to a point where the
trees seem to merge into one
another, as parallel lines invariably
appear to do. But flat as the
country may be, you will always
find yourself confronted with a
gentle incline, as it seems, very
slight but none the less perceptible.
You brace for a long and steady
climb, yet somehow, as you cover
the ground, the hill seems always
before you and yet there is no
noticeable ascent. The reason is
simple. There <i>is</i> no ascent. The
borders of trees, like the little lines in <a href="#Fig62_6">Fig. 6</a>, deceive the eyes in
a similar way until it is almost impossible to believe that the hill is
merely an optical illusion, and that the
road is flat as the proverbial pancake.</p>

<p>There is another trick the eye is
very fond of playing us. A straight
line, held on a level with the eye
appears very much shorter than it
really is. Look at <a href="#Fig62_7">Fig. 7</a>, which
appears to represent a number of pins
lying with their points towards you.
Now lift the book to the level of the
eyes, close the right one, and they will
appear to be sticking upright in the
page.</p>

<p>What a jumble of lines there is
in <a href="#Fig62_8">Fig. 8</a>, something like a spider&#8217;s
web, and one can make nothing out of it. But lift the book up, as in
the last example, and close one eye&mdash;the letters are plain enough, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page523">[523]</span>
they not? You have played a trick on your own eye, and made its
habit of shortening lines serve to interpret a message that would
otherwise be unintelligible.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Stars don&#8217;t Twinkle</span></h3>

<p>Every cloudless night the eyes make a mistake that we can easily
discover, but which we are totally unable to remedy.</p>

<p>Of course you have looked up to the sky thousands of times and
seen the stars twinkling. Not only that, but if the night is clear you
can see they are stellate, or star-shaped, like the starfish which is
named after them. You can see both of these things, and yet the
strange fact is that neither of them is true!</p>

<p>The stars do not twinkle at all, and they are not stellate. The
twinkling is the result of the intervening atmosphere, and not
the fault of our eyes; but the second error can be easily brought
home to our untrustworthy organs of vision by the following
experiment.</p>

<div class="figleft w250" id="Fig62_9">

<img src="images/illo523.png" alt="" width="250" height="75" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;The illusion of the stars.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Take a piece of tinfoil and prick a small hole with the point of a
pin. Now when it is dark put a candle behind the tinfoil in such a
way that the light comes through the tiny hole. Hold the tinfoil
about ten inches from your face, and the hole will appear irregular.
If you bring it nearer, it will lose even the least resemblance to a hole
and appear as a star! Of course you know perfectly well that it is
round, but your eyes have deceived
you once more in the same way
that they deceive you every starlight
night, and the little hole looks something
like <a href="#Fig62_9">Fig. 9</a>&mdash;varying slightly with
each individual observer. This deception,
or to put it charitably, this
mistake of the eyes, is given the very high-sounding name of &#8220;irregular
astigmatism,&#8221; but for all that it is an illusion pure and simple.</p>

<p>Like many well-trained servants, the eyes are quite at a loss if
anything contrary to the usual routine is presented to them. They
know perfectly well the laws of perspective,&mdash;how in the ordinary
course of nature these laws are never broken by a hairbreadth. They
are therefore accustomed to judge in the fraction of an instant the
size of an object by its apparent distance away. That this is the result
of practice can be easily seen from the fact that very young creatures&mdash;human
and otherwise&mdash;have no idea of the relative distances of
objects, and strain to touch a distant gas-light, or, like a young calf,
rush headlong into a neighboring wall which their green young<span class="pagenum" id="Page524">[524]</span>
fancy deludes them into thinking is really some distance away. But
as we grow older we learn many things, and perspective amongst
others.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dwarf, the Man, and the Giant</span></h3>

<p>Now if we make a drawing such as <a href="#Fig62_10">Fig. 10</a>, which represents three
men walking down a passage, our eyes know quite well that if all
these men were of the same size, Mr. Jones in front would appear
smaller than Mr.
Smith behind him.
And Mr. Smith in
his turn would appear
smaller than
Brown who closes
the procession.</p>

<p>Yet in our illustration
Jones appears
a veritable
giant, towering
above Smith and
making Brown appear
a mere pigmy.
If you measure
them, you will find
they are all three
the same size.</p>

<p>The reason of
the deception is this.
The lines showing
the passage disappearing
into the
far distance immediately
suggest to
the eye the correct
perspective, and,
knowing the laws of that perspective, the eye is perfectly convinced
that if all three were the same size, Brown in the rear would appear
proportionately bigger than Jones. As he does not do so, the eye
immediately leaps to the conclusion that he must be very much
smaller. It therefore telegraphs to the brain that Brown is a dwarf,
following in the tracks of an ordinary man and a giant!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page525">[525]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Color Illusions</span></h3>

<p>Most of us know the result of turning a series of circles (as
in <a href="#Fig62_11">Fig. 11</a>) horizontally with the eye. The circles appear to revolve
rapidly round their center, and in different directions. This is
solely because the eyes become confused, giving one more proof, were
it needed, that they are no more infallible than anything else on this
wide earth.</p>

<p>Some very interesting experiments in color illusions can be
made. So cunning is the deception played upon us by our eyes, it is
extremely difficult to believe that some of the tints we see in the
experiments are but imaginary.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w220" id="Fig62_11">

<img src="images/illo525a.png" alt="" width="215" height="252" />

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>In <a href="#Fig62_12">Fig. 12</a> you see a top which can be constructed of cardboard
in this way. Take a postcard and cut a circle, upon which you
draw a diameter as A B. Black the part A C B with India ink, and
divide the other half into four equal portions by lightly penciling
the radii G E, G D, and G F. Now, still using your India ink, make
arcs in these four divisions in the same way as is shown in the figure.</p>

<div class="figright w250" id="Fig62_13">

<img src="images/illo526.png" alt="" width="250" height="248" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;To make black
print red.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Having done this carefully and rubbed out the pencil radii
when the ink has dried, put a pin through the center G from the
back, so that the card can easily revolve whilst the pin-head prevents
it from falling off. Your color top is now ready. Make it
turn rapidly upon the pin; look closely at the card and what do you
see? The inner circles become red and the outer ones blue! And
yet you know perfectly well that the only colors really upon the card
are black and white!</p>

<p>You can make another top, after a similar fashion. Cut your<span class="pagenum" id="Page526">[526]</span>
postcard as before, making one half of it black. Now, out of the
white side, cut a segment with an angle of 45 degrees, leaving a little
piece near the center as shown in <a href="#Fig62_13">Fig. 13</a>. This piece you have
left has nothing to do with the effect, but is
simply to make the top revolve better.</p>

<p>Take an ordinary book, of which the
printing is presumably black, and revolve
the top upon the pin at the rate of about
five turns a second (a sharp twitch with the
finger will do this perfectly well). If you
look at the printing now you will find the
letters are colored red, as though the book
had been printed in red ink!</p>

<p>In both these experiments the alternation
of black and white has not only confused
the eye, but has deceived it into seeing colors
which do not really exist.</p>

<p>So we have shown very conclusively that the old proverb, &#8220;all
is not gold that glitters,&#8221; can be applied to even the plainest of
black and white; and, as the poet remarks, &#8220;things are not what
they seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, when people wish to impress you with the evidence
of their own eyes and clinch an argument by stating that they saw
such and such a thing and cannot be wrong, show some of these
optical illusions and demand a better proof of what they affirm,
very courteously assuring the dogmatist that the best of eyes are
liable to make mistakes.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LXIII</b><br />
CIPHERS AND CRYPTOGRAMS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Successful Systems of Secret Writing</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the earliest times secret writing has been considered no less an
art than a necessity. Innumerable have been the systems invented
and the means employed to insure the secrecy of messages and
instructions. Yet in the passage of time by far the greater number
of these methods of cipher has become obsolete and practically useless,
failing in most cases to comply with the three great necessities which
Bacon declared to be indispensable to all ciphers and cryptograms:
(1) Easy of reading and writing; (2) difficult of solution; and (3)
void of suspicion.</p>

<p>Ciphers may be generally divided into two branches&mdash;code ciphers
and letter ciphers. The first of these terms refers to systems so
arranged that one group of characters represents several words or
sentences, whilst the other term designates those cryptograms where
each letter in every word has its corresponding symbol.</p>

<p>As letter ciphers are the more usual, and certainly the handier of
the two classes, examples are given of some systems which have been
successfully used at different times and for different purposes.</p>

<p>The simplest of all methods, and, for that matter, the easiest to
be detected, consists in having an arbitrary list of numbers, one of
which shall represent each letter in the alphabet&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, A appears as 4,
B as 8, C as 12, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This plan can be varied by substituting letters for the numbers,
and having each letter of the alphabet represented by another letter&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
A being substituted by G, B by L, C by Q, and so on; but the
disadvantages attending these very simple ciphers are so great that
for a message of any real importance the system is useless.</p>

<p>In the same way the expedient of reversing the alphabet and
making A represented by Z, B by Y, C by X, is too simple and
generally known to require further description.</p>

<p>One of the easiest and earliest ciphers is shown in <a href="#Fig63_1">Fig. 1</a>. This
is written in the following manner: The &#8220;bounding&#8221; lines in which
the desired letters are contained are drawn and the position of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page528">[528]</span>
letter in them indicated by a dot. Taking, for example, <a href="#Fig63_1">Fig. 1</a>, A
would be one dot, B two, and C three dots inscribed inside the
two lines forming the angle. Thus the word CIPHER would be
written <img src="images/illo528a.png" alt="C" width="26" height="25" class="cipher" />
<img src="images/illo528b.png" alt="I" width="27" height="25" class="cipher" />
<img src="images/illo528c.png" alt="P" width="29" height="25" class="cipher" />
<img src="images/illo528d.png" alt="H" width="29" height="25" class="cipher" />

<img src="images/illo528f.png" alt="R" width="30" height="25" class="cipher" />.</p>

<p>At this point it might be remarked that in all the examples
here given the letters are arranged in their simplest order&mdash;that of
alphabetical sequence; whereas, for practical purposes, they can be
arranged in any form desired, the more complicated the better. To
illustrate this <a href="#Fig63_2">Fig. 2</a> shows another arrangement of the letters, by
using which the same word would appear

<p class="blankbefore75">An example of another simple cipher created merely by the transposition

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Transposition
of<br />letters
cipher.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Lord Bacon invented a cipher composed of
two letters only, which, although confusing to the
uninitiated, is somewhat too cumbersome for any
general use. Supposing the two letters decided
upon to be A and B, they are grouped into series
of five and employed in the following manner: The
first letter in the alphabet, A, is represented by
AAAAA, B becomes AAAAB, C appears as AAABA, D as AABAA.
Using this combination, the same word &#8220;cipher&#8221; would be written
AAABA, BBAAA, BBBBB, AABBA, ABAAA, BBBAB.</p>

<p>Amongst the easy ciphers must be mentioned that shown in <a href="#Fig63_4">Fig. 4</a>,
which is used thus: In the center block of small type you find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page529">[529]</span>
letters of the word you wish to write in cipher. Suppose it to be
TO-MORROW. Now in the vertical column at the side you find
that the letter on a line with &#8220;t&#8221; is A, whilst the letter at the top of
the vertical column is G. Therefore the cipher letters for &#8220;t&#8221; are AG.
The next letter, &#8220;o,&#8221; is on a line with B and under E, so the cipher
letters are BE. In a similar way &#8220;m&#8221; becomes CD, and, proceeding
with the remaining letters in the same fashion, we obtain the whole
word written in cipher thus: AG, BE, CD, BE, BF, BF, BE, CG.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Russian Nihilist Code</span></h3>

<p>An adaptation of the last-mentioned system is shown in <a href="#Fig63_5">Fig. 5</a>,
where the letters at the side and top are replaced by numerals. This
method is very much in use amongst the Russian Nihilists, who would
therefore write the sentence &#8220;Plot discovered&#8221; as follows: 41, 32,
35, 45; 14, 24, 44, 13, 35, 51, 15, 43, 15, 14.</p>

<p>This, again, can be very much complicated by multiplying each
number by the position held by the letter in the word. Thus in the
sentence just put into cipher, P is the first letter in the word &#8220;plot,&#8221;
L is the second, O the third, T the fourth, whilst in the next word
D is the first, I the second, &amp;c. You therefore multiply the ciphers
in the first word by 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and deal similarly with
those of the second word. The sentence thus treated would appear&mdash;41,
64, 105, 180; 14, 48, 132, 52, 175, 306, 105, 344, 135, 140.</p>

<p>To read this the system must be reversed, and each number divided
by its position in the word.</p>

<p>A useful form of musical cipher is shown in <a href="#Fig63_6">Fig. 6</a>,
which explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page530">[530]</span>
itself. In using this system it is usual to separate the different words
by dividing the notes into bars, as can be seen from a glance at
<a href="#Fig63_7">Fig. 7</a>. Here it will be noticed that only crotchets and minims are
used for ciphers, whilst the other notes introduced have no significance,
only serving the purpose of confusing whoever has sufficient
curiosity to pry into the message. Therefore, discordant as the
passage may sound to the wrong person, it probably makes very
sweet music to whoever has ears and eyes to understand its meaning.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to more complicated ciphers, that known as the
fractional may be mentioned. This is a very simple method, and
easily learned. The letters of the alphabet are divided into groups
of five as shown in <a href="#Fig63_8">Fig. 8</a>, each group being marked successively up
to five, and each letter in the group treated in the same way. The
numerator is used to designate the group to which the letter belongs,
whilst the denominator shows the individual letter in that group.</p>

have been employed by various Governments in correspondence with
their ambassadors and secret servants.</p>

<p>The Sphinx Cipher, shown in <a href="#Fig63_11">Fig. 11</a>, is based upon a key-word
of six or seven letters, previously arranged by the parties concerned
A key-alphabet is written in full at the top of the plan, and against
each letter of the key-word a complete alphabet is written as shown
in the figure.</p>

is W, and you see that the letter on a line with B and under W is X,
which will be the first letter of your cipher. You then find A above
and A by the side, which will give you C. You then find R above, and
in the L horizontal column is its equivalent U. Proceeding thus
with your message you arrive at the cipher, which reads: XCU

<p class="blankbefore75">The cipher is used in this way. The letters in each word of the
message are divided into couples. These couples are found in the
doubled alphabets in the center of the cipher scheme, and the key
letters at the side and top show the actual cipher equivalent.</p>

<p>Suppose it is desired to put into this cipher the words CABLE
CODE. Dividing the letters into couples CA, BL, E. CO, DE are
obtained. Finding the combination CA it is simple to ascertain that
the index letters are TM, which is therefore the cipher. BL is EL,
whilst the remaining letter E from the top alphabet is found to be SO.
Treating the word CODE in the same way the ciphers prove to be
HM, XN, and therefore the message is transmitted thus: TMELSO
HMXN.</p>

<p>So far an idea has been given of the systems of cipher from the
simplest methods to the most complicated of political cryptograms.
Although the actual details are necessarily hidden, it may be assumed
as a positive fact that the most secret political ciphers now in use by
civilized Governments are but adaptations of one or other of the
methods described.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LXIV</b><br />
SECRET SIGNS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Friend from Foe</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a condition of affairs where every man&#8217;s hand was against his
neighbor&#8217;s, the necessity of being able to tell friend from foe was
more urgent than in these peaceable times.</p>

<p>When plotting was rife upon every hand, and one man possibly
held the lives of many confederates in his power, knowing that an
incautious word of his might doom them all to punishment and probably
death, it became of paramount importance to have some means
of discerning allies from enemies.</p>

<p>Obviously the means of finding out such important information
must be such as to awaken no suspicion in the event of a mistake,
whilst on the other hand there should be no possibility of a stranger
inadvertently obtaining possession of the secret.</p>

<p>From earliest times the formation of Secret Societies has necessitated
the invention of Secret Signs, and in nine cases out of ten, it
may be said, the extinction of the societies from one cause or another
has resulted in the loss of their secret signs of recognition.</p>

<p>There are, however, even now, several Societies or Fraternities
whose members are possessed of certain signs whereby they can know
each other, and in several cases they claim lineal descent from some
of the old fraternities whose origins are lost in antiquity.</p>

<p>However, now that universal liberty, especially in this country, has
abolished the necessity for concealment, secret political societies have
disappeared, and with them their complicated systems of signs, tokens,
and pass-words.</p>

<p>In certain colleges and schools societies still exist, and as a secret
bond is held by many to be a very effective link in the dearest of
friendships, below are given a few suggestions to enable you to invent
some secret signs which shall be a tie between yourself and such
friends as you may consider worthy of initiation into their meanings.</p>

<p>Like verbs, secret signs may be roughly classed into active and
passive. Active signs are those which are given by movements of the
limbs or contortions of the face, whilst passive signs are connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page534">[534]</span>
entirely with the disposal of parts of the clothing or the wearing of
various objects attached to the person.</p>

<p>Amongst active signs, the readiest in execution are those performed
by the hands in view of the person, whose attention it is
desired to attract, <i>e.g.</i>, the signs can be given at the moment of shaking
hands, where such a ceremony is observed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Shakes&#8221; and &#8220;Passes&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>In this latter case a very good &#8220;shake&#8221; can be obtained by pressing
the thumb firmly against the back of the hand, as shown in
<a href="#Fig64_1">Fig. 1</a>. This will arouse no
suspicion in anybody ignorant
of the meaning, though, if reciprocated,
it forms an excellent
sign of recognition.</p>

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<div class="figcenter w320" id="Fig64_1">

<img src="images/illo534a.png" alt="" width="315" height="218" />

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The variety of passes that
can be executed with different
meanings is astonishing. Yet
it should be remembered that,
although outsiders may not know what you are saying, it will always
be apparent that &#8220;something is up,&#8221; and a very undesirable curiosity
will be awakened.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many little actions, unnoticeable in
themselves, which may have a great meaning to those &#8220;in the know.&#8221;</p>

<p>A simple stroking of the eyebrows
(<a href="#Fig64_2">Fig. 2</a>) is to all appearances a harmless
movement, but in the secret signs of
a well-known society it meant that
treachery was in the air, and every
person in the room would have to be
watched.</p>

<p>In a certain Italian Society, clasping
the forehead with the left hand as
though in extreme weariness (<a href="#Fig64_3">Fig. 3</a>)
implied: &#8220;Be cautious, you are being
watched.&#8221; A similar action with the
right hand meant: &#8220;We are known, make your escape as best you
can; leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same society, when a member found himself in a mixed
assembly, and desired to ascertain who amongst the guests belonged
to his fraternity, he would stroke his left cheek thoughtfully with
extended first and second fingers, as in <a href="#Fig64_4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page535">[535]</span></p>

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p>The brethren of a very respectable society, which still flourishes,
are generally credited with knowing each other by a peculiar flourish
of the hand when removing the
hat, in a somewhat similar manner
to that shown in <a href="#Fig64_5">Fig. 5</a>. Others
make the ceremony of blowing
the nose of like importance.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig64_5">

<img src="images/illo535c.png" alt="" width="350" height="326" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;The hat flourish.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>There used to be a famous
Italian Secret Society divided
into several classes or degrees,
each of which had its own
especial sign. For the first
three degrees these signs were
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1st. The right hand is raised
to the shoulder, and then passed
slowly down across the body to
the left knee.</p>

<p>2nd. The right hand is placed
upon the left shoulder, then
drawn slowly down the left arm
until it reaches the hand. Thus clasped they are raised to the breast.</p>

<p>3rd. The right hand is clasped, the thumb and little finger extended.
The former is placed against the lips, whilst the latter touches
the breast.</p>

<p>Those who desire to invent secret signs should avoid all those
dependent upon an unnecessary action, like the hat-flourish. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page536">[536]</span>
more satisfactory to apply the secret to some everyday action which,
from its very unobtrusiveness, will attract the attention of no stranger.</p>

<p>Members of certain religious secret societies to this day distinguish
one another by a peculiar style of cross, worn as a pendant from the
watch-chain, whilst a pass-word is current amongst them to enable
them to test those whom they meet wearing the symbol.</p>

<p>The use of flowers in the button-hole is a very common method of
attracting recognition, whilst a development of the same idea is seen
in the wearing of different colored neckties or ribbons, which in a
crowd will pass unnoticed save by those whose attention is desired.
Yet to both of these systems a certain danger is attached, for there is
always the chance of some unsuspecting person quite inadvertently
wearing the same flowers or colors.</p>

<p>Every one has heard of the language of flowers, but it is surprising
to what an extent this can be carried by enterprising young ladies
with a good collection in the garden or green house.</p>

<p>It has been frequently proved that some safeguard is a necessary
addition to the sign, and this safeguard usually takes the form of a
pass-word. Repeated after the sign has been given, this word serves
to show that the secret sign was neither given by accident nor picked
up through curiosity.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pass-Words</span></h3>

<p>Pass-words, and the methods of giving them, vary considerably.
The word, which must of course be known to all duly intrusted with
the secret, should be of two syllables.</p>

<p>One party called A says the first syllable, and the other person B
repeats the second, then saying the whole word. Supposing the pass-word
chosen be Oxford, A would make some remark introducing the
word Ox, whilst B, replying in a similar vein, would mention the last
syllable &#8220;ford&#8221; and conclude by repeating the whole word. With
this system it is almost impossible for an outsider to palm himself off
as one of the elect, even if he has become acquainted with all the signs
of the society.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that gypsies have a concerted plan of
signals which are employed to show members of the party the direction
taken by their leaders.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Patteran&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>The &#8220;patteran,&#8221; as it is called, is made in various ways. A piece
of rag fluttering from some bush near a cross-road, is a favorite<span class="pagenum" id="Page537">[537]</span>
signal, whilst small twigs or leaves strewn in a particular direction,
have a somewhat similar meaning.</p>

<p>Tramps and vagrants of all kinds have a series of signs, which
they chalk upon the walls of the various houses at which they call,
serving to inform their brethren of the treatment received at the hands
of the occupiers.</p>

<p>By this method a rude cross will usually describe the rather chilling
welcome offered them by an irate householder, whilst a rough
sketch of a loaf of bread shows that the inmates are sufficiently sympathetic
to dispense with a portion of &#8220;the staff of life.&#8221; On the other
hand, an upraised leg with a boot upon its foot tells a tale which need
not be further enlarged upon.</p>

<p>As to the various modes of recognition that can be produced by
whistles and cries of all kinds, they are too familiar to require description
in these pages.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER LXV</b><br />
GAMES AND AMUSEMENTS FOR THE BLIND</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Wonderful Sense of Touch</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> cannot fail to strike those of us who are blessed with the use of our
eyes how extremely fortunate it is that our blind friends need not be
debarred from many of our games. Being deprived of their sight,
their sense of touch is developed to such
an incredible extent that in the playing
of many games their fingers prove of
the same use to them as our eyes do
to us.</p>

<p>Practically all games for the blind can
be purchased at very moderate cost, yet
as they can be quite easily made at home
the following hints are offered in the hope
that they will prove of use, and help some
of our readers to entertain a friend less
fortunate than themselves.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cards</span></h3>

<p>An ordinary pack of cards can be very
simply adapted to the use of the blind.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig65_1">

<img src="images/illo538a.png" alt="" width="250" height="346" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Distinguishing marks for suits and color respectively.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>By means of a large pin, the designation and value of a card can
be pricked on the back, so that the upraised holes are perceptible to
touch. These values and denominations should be pricked in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page539">[539]</span>
corner where the small designation of the value of a card is always to
be found, as in <a href="#Fig65_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig65_2">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#Fig65_3">3</a> are shown the marks which should be pricked.
These are in the Braille alphabet, now universally understood by the
blind, and read by them with the same ease as we read printing.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page540">[540]</span></p>

<p>In Whist or Bridge, each person, as he plays his card, states what
it is, King of Hearts, and so on, as this saves feeling the cards after
they have been laid on the table.</p>

<p>A very suitable game, calculated to amuse the player for hours, is
Patience, under all its forms. For this the cards must be prepared
somewhat differently, as in many games the first thing to be distinguished
is the color.</p>

<p>The handiest plan is to mark a B or an R for Black or Red, in
Braille characters immediately before, or underneath the denomination.
A glance at <a href="#Fig65_4">Fig. 4</a> will serve to show what is meant.</p>

<p>With the cards thus marked, any game of Patience can be played
as easily by a blind person as by an ordinary player.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Checkers</span></h3>

<p>An ordinary Checker Board can be adapted for the use of the
blind with very little trouble and no expense.</p>

<p>Cut thirty-two squares of thick cardboard, each square identical in
size with the black squares on the Checker Board. Upon each of the
black spaces one of these pieces of card should be glued, so that when
complete the board is composed of sunk and raised instead of colored
squares.</p>

<p>For the convenience of any ordinary person who may be playing
with a blind opponent, the cardboard squares should be colored black
with India ink.</p>

<p>The checkers usually purchased have a molding on both top and
bottom. It will simplify matters considerably if you can buy a set with
one side only molded. By using the white men with the molding uppermost
and the black men reversed, as in <a href="#Fig65_5">Fig. 5</a>, the difference will be
sufficient to enable the blind person to distinguish by touch.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig65_5">

<img src="images/illo540.png" alt="" width="450" height="94" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Molded (white) and plain (black) draughts for the blind.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>The same result can be obtained by glueing discs of cardboard or
stiff paper, upon one side of each man, of one of the sets.</p>

<h3 id="Ref11"><span class="smcap">Halma</span></h3>

<p>The preparation of a Halma board is very similar to that of a
checker board. Having raised the alternate squares with cardboard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page541">[541]</span>
the &#8220;Homes&#8221; at each corner should be further raised by glueing a
piece of cardboard over all the spaces, and then raising the alternate
squares upon this base, as in <a href="#Fig65_6">Figs. 6</a> and <a href="#Fig65_6A">6<i>a</i></a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig65_6">

<img src="images/illo541a.png" alt="" width="600" height="57" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Section of Halma board showing &#8220;Home.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>In the center of each square a nail should be driven from the
back of the board, with the end cut off and point filed to smoothness.
These nails should project
from the face of the board
about half an inch. The
ordinary Halma men have a
hole on the under side, which
enables you to place them
upon the upraised points,
where they will be held
firmly.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig65_6A">

<img src="images/illo541b.png" alt="" width="250" height="262" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6<i>a</i>.&mdash;Plan of raised corner.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>It will now be necessary
to make some alteration in
the men, to distinguish the
colors. In <a href="#Fig65_7">Fig. 7</a> an idea
of how this may be done is
given. The Yellow men are
left untouched, Black have
their heads cut right off,
Red have one half of the
head cut away, while the
Green have the head sharpened to a point.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig65_7">

<img src="images/illo541c.png" alt="" width="500" height="157" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Color distinctions for Halma men.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<h3><span class="smcap">Dominoes</span></h3>

<p>Owing to their construction, Dominoes really need no alteration to
make them suitable for the blind, but care should be taken when<span class="pagenum" id="Page542">[542]</span>
purchasing to see that the pips are cut deep into the ivory, so that the
player can tell at a touch how many there are in the piece before him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chess</span></h3>

<p>This is one of the games in which the blind frequently excel, and
in consequence it is a general favorite. The undivided attention they
are able to give, and the natural acuteness which their affliction usually
brings to such a pitch of excellence, serves them in good stead when
playing &#8220;the king of games.&#8221;</p>

<p>The board should be prepared as in the case of checkers, <i>with
the exception that points should be made from the back</i>, in the manner
described in connection with the <a href="#Ref11">Halma board</a>.</p>

<p>The different men are, of course, by their construction, easily distinguishable
from one another, but it will assist matters very materially
if a set is used in which the men differ considerably in shape and size.</p>

<p>In the center of each piece a hole must be bored in the base, large
enough to allow the man to be placed, and removed from one pin to
another with ease. For this reason wooden chess men are preferable.</p>

<p>The question of distinguishing the colors has been solved in
various ways. In some cases the tops of the men of one color have
been halved, as shown in <a href="#Fig65_8">Fig. 8</a>, and this has proved a very satisfactory
arrangement.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig65_8">

<img src="images/illo542.png" alt="" width="500" height="230" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Color distinctions for Chess men.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Others have used the black men of one set and the white men of
another, but this plan is hardly to be recommended, owing to the
similarity prevailing between all chess men.</p>

<p>The following method seems to be as good as any, and has the
advantage of being easily contrived. Drive a pin firmly into the heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page543">[543]</span>
of one set of men (say the black), and either leave plain, or make a
little knob of sealing-wax around the pinhead. This will render the
different colors perfectly distinguishable to the blind player.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Round Games</span></h3>

<p>In the majority of round games the blind are able to take an
active part, but this depends very much upon the individual concerned.
As a general rule rough games should be avoided, especially
if the space for playing be limited.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="Fig65_9">

<img src="images/illo543.png" alt="" width="350" height="523" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;The Braille Alphabet.</p>

</div><!--div figure-->

<p>Games in which a certain amount of writing is requisite are rarely
suitable, although here again it must be a matter solely dependent
upon the person concerned.</p>

<p>At spelling and guessing games the cleverest seeing player must
look to his or her laurels, for the blind are very quick-witted in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page544">[544]</span>
contests, and frequently have the answer ready while others are still
repeating the question.</p>

<p>As a matter of interest as well as of use, the blind alphabet of the
Braille system is shown in <a href="#Fig65_9">Fig. 9</a>, and by this means letters and notes
can be written, which will be perfectly intelligible to a blind person.
In pricking the characters through a paper, it should be remembered
that the points must be reversed, and the letters begun from right to
left, as the blind person will read from the other side, where the pin-pricked
holes will have raised little points of paper.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>The language used in the source document has been retained (including inconsistent, archaic and unusual spelling, hyphenation and
capitalisation), except as mentioned below. In particular, non-English words and phrases have not been corrected unless mentioned
under &#8220;Changes made&#8221;.</p>

<p>The (minor) deviations in spelling in the Index compared to the text have not been standardised.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all elements may display as intended.</p>

<p>Discrepancies between illustrations and their descriptions (e.g., Fig. 1B in Chapter L) have not been rectified unless listed below.
Items that cannot work as described (e.g. the rotating target in Chapter XX) have not been corrected or explicitly noted.
Possibly offensive language (e.g.
in the minstrel entertainment) and dangerous activities (as the experiments with hydrogen and chlorine gas) have been included in this
transcription without further explicit warning.</p>

<p>Page 119, the David: as printed in the source document.</p>

<p>Page 184, The space, D, G, is also invisible: possibly an error for The space, D, C, is also invisible.</p>

<p>Page 216, The code for playing cards ...: the intended meaning of the suits
(clubs and spades) given and the explanation (well and very well) in
the text contradict each other.</p>

<p>Page 238. Fig. 9: the illustration may have been printed upside-down (cf. Fig. 10 and the text).</p>

<p>Page 295, various combinations of wines and liquids: as printed in the source document. Possibly an error for wires and liquids.</p>

<p>Page 458: It is not clear why One-blank is not listed.</p>

<p>Page 522, Figs. 7 and 8: The illusion &#8220;the standing pins&#8221; may not work in all formats; the bottom part of Fig.
8 has been added because it may be impossible to see the solution according to the directions given when reading this e-text.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Changes made</p>

<p>The (single) footnote has been moved to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Some minor obvious typographical and punctuation errors and misprints have been corrected silently.</p>

<p>Page 65: emotional parts of thumping changed to emotional parts or thumping.</p>

<p>Page 214: closing bracket added after the last two responses by the professor.</p>

<p>Page 257: The complete illustration consisting of Figs. 10-12 has been flipped horizontally, as have the individual figures.</p>

<p>Page 295: &#8216;the coil has been mentioned&#8217; changed to &#8216;the coin has been mentioned&#8217;.</p>

<p>Page 438: reference to Fig. 2 changed to reference to Fig. 3.</p>

<p>Page 475: CHAPTER LVIX changed to CHAPTER LIX.</p>
